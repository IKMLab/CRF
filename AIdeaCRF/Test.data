-mediated
liposomal
delivery
system
.

The
conjugation
of
tunable
peptides
or
materials
with
nanocarriers
represents
a
promising
approach
for
drug
delivery
to
tumor
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
report
the
development
of
a
novel
liposomal
carrier
system
that
exploits
the
cell
surface
binding
synergism
between
photo
-sensitive
peptides
(
PSPs
)
and
targeting
ligands
.

The
positive
charges
of
the
lysine
residues
on
the
cell
-penetrating
peptides
(
CPPs
)
were
temporarily
caged
by
the
photolabile
-protective
groups
(
PG
)
,
thereby
forming
a
PSP
.

Furthermore
,
this
PSP
enhances
specific
uptake
into
cancer
cells
after
rapidly
uncaging
the
PG
via
near
-infrared
(
NIR
)
light
illumination
.

In
the
circulatory
system
,
the
cell
penetrability
of
PSP
was
hindered
.

In
contrast
,
the
asparagine-glycine-arginine
(
NGR
)
peptide
moieties
,
selectively
bind
to
CD13
-positive
tumors
,
were
attached
to
the
nanocarrier
to
facilitate
the
active
accumulation
of
this
liposomal
carrier
in
tumor
tissue
.

The
dual
-modified
liposomes
(
PSP
/
NGR-L
)
were
prepared
by
emulsification
method
,
and
the
concentrations
of
DSPE-PEG2000-psCPP
and
DSPE-PEG5000-NGR
in
the
liposomes
were
chosen
to
be
4
%
and
1
%
(
molar
ratio
)
,
respectively
.

The
mean
particle
size
of
the
PSP
/
NGR-L
was
about
95
nm
,
and
the
drug
entrapment
efficiency
was
more
than
90
%
.

Cellular
uptake
results
demonstrated
that
the
proposed
PSP
/
NGR-L
had
an
enhancement
of
cancer
cell
recognition
and
specific
uptake
.

Furthermore
,
the
PSP
/
NGR-L
demonstrated
a
stronger
antitumor
efficacy
in
the
HT-1080
tumor
model
in
nude
mice
with
the
aid
of
NIR
illumination

Interaction
of
IFN-γ
with
cholinergic
agonists
to
modulate
rat
and
human
goblet
cell
function
.

Goblet
cells
populate
wet
-surfaced
mucosa
including
the
conjunctiva
of
the
eye
,
intestine
,
and
nose
,
among
others
.

These
cells
function
as
part
of
the
innate
immune
system
by
secreting
high
molecular
weight
mucins
that
interact
with
environmental
constituents
including
pathogens
,
allergens
,
and
particulate
pollutants
.

Herein
,
we
determined
whether
interferon
gamma
(
IFN-γ
)
,
a
Th1
cytokine
increased
in
dry
eye
,
alters
goblet
cell
function
.

Goblet
cells
from
rat
and
human
conjunctiva
were
cultured
.

Changes
in
intracellular
[

]
(
[
Ca

]
(

)
,
high
molecular

glycoconjugate
secretion
,
and
proliferation
were
measured
after
stimulation
with
IFN-γ
with
or
without
the
cholinergic
agonist
carbachol
.

IFN-γ
itself
increased
[
Ca
(
2+
)
]
(
i
)
in
rat
and
human
goblet
cells
and
prevented
the
increase
in
[
Ca
(
2+
)
]
(
i
)
caused
by
carbachol
.

Carbachol
prevented
IFN-γ
-mediated
increase
in
[
Ca
(
2+
)
]
(
i
)
.

This
cross-talk
between
IFN-γ
and
muscarinic
receptors
may
be
partially
due
to
use
of
the
same
Ca
(
2+
)
(
i
)
reservoirs
,
but
also
from
interaction
of
signaling
pathways
proximal
to
the
increase
in
[
Ca
(
2+
)
]
(
i
)
.

IFN-γ
blocked
carbachol
-induced
high
molecular
weight
glycoconjugate
secretion
and
reduced
goblet
cell
proliferation
.

We
conclude
that
increased
levels
of
IFN-γ
in
dry
eye
disease
could
explain
the
lack
of
goblet
cells
and
mucin
deficiency
typically
found
in
this
pathology
.

IFN-γ
could
also
function
similarly
in
respiratory
and
gastrointestinal
tracts
.

Simulated
soil
crust
conditions
in
a
chamber
system
provide
new
insights
on
cyanobacterial
acclimation
to
desiccation
.

Environmental
research
often
faces
two
major
hurdles
:
(
i
)
fluctuating
spatial
and
temporal
conditions
and
consequently
large
variability
in
the
organisms'abundance
and
performance
,
and
(
ii
)
complex
,
costly
logistics
involved
in
field
experiments
.

Measurements
of
physiological
parameters
or
molecular
analyses
often
represent
single
shot
experiments
.

To
study
desiccation
acclimation
of
filamentous
cyanobacteria
,
the
founders
and
main
primary
producers
in
desert
biological
soil
crusts
(
BSC
)
,
we
constructed
an
environmental
chamber
that
can
reproducibly
and
accurately
simulate
ambient
conditions
and
measure
microorganism
performance
.

We
show
that
recovery
from
desiccation
of
BSC
cyanobacteria
and
Leptolyngbya
ohadii
isolated
thereof
are
strongly
affected
by
dehydration
rate
following
morning
dew
.

This
effect
is
most
pronounced
in
cells
exposed
to
high
light
and
temperature
in
the
dry
phase
.

Simultaneous
measurements
of
water
content
,
gas
exchange
and
fluorescence
were
performed
during
dehydration
.

Photosynthetic
performance
measured
by
fluorescence
begins
declining
when
light
intensity
reaches
values
above
100
μmol
photons
m
(
-2
)
s
(
-1
)
,
even
in
fully
hydrated
cells
.

In
contrast
,
photosynthetic
rates
measured
using
O2
evolution
and
CO2
uptake
increased
during
rising
irradiance
to
the
point
where
the
water
content
declined
below
∼
50
%
.

Thus
,
fluorescence
can
not
serve
as
a
reliable
measure
of
photosynthesis
in
desert
cyanobacteria
.

The
effects
of
drying
on
gas
exchange
are
discussed

The
formation
of
titan
cells
in
Cryptococcus
neoformans
depends
on
the
mouse
strain
and
correlates
with
induction
of
Th2-type
responses
.

Cryptococcus
neoformans
is
a
pathogenic
yeast
that
can
form
titan
cells
in
the
lungs
,
which
are
fungal
cells
of
abnormal
enlarged
size
.

Little
is
known
about
the
factors
that
trigger
titan
cells
.

In
particular
,
it
is
not
known
how
the
host
environment
influences
this
transition
.

In
this
work
,
we
describe
the
formation
of
titan
cells
in
two
mouse
strains
,
CD1
and
C57BL
/
6J
.

We
found
that
the
proportion
of
C.
neoformans
titan
cells
was
significantly
higher
in
C57BL
/
6J
mice
than
in
CD1
.

This
higher
proportion
of
titan
cells
was
associated
with
a
higher
dissemination
of
the
yeasts
to
the
brain
.

Histology
sections
demonstrated
eosinophilia
in
infected
animals
,
although
it
was
significantly
lower
in
the
CD1
mice
which
presented
infiltration
of
lymphocytes
.

Both
mouse
strains
presented
infiltration
of
granulocytes
,
but
the
amount
of
eosinophils
was
higher
in
C57BL
/
6J
.

CD1
mice
showed
a
significant
accumulation
of
IFN-γ
,
TNF-α
and
IL17
,
while
C57BL
/
BL
mice
had
an
increase
in
the
anti-inflammatory
cytokine
IL-4
.

IgM
antibodies
to
the
polysaccharide
capsule
and
total
IgE
were
more
abundant
in
the
sera
from
C57BL
/
6J
,
confirming
that
these
animals
present
a
Th2-type
response
.

We
conclude
that
titan
cell
formation
in
C.
neoformans
depends
,
not
only
on
microbe
factors
,
but
also
on
the
host
environment
.

Anaplasma
phagocytophilum
Rab10
-dependent
parasitism
of
the
trans-Golgi
network
is
critical
for
completion
of
the
infection
cycle
.

Anaplasma
phagocytophilum
is
an
emerging
human
pathogen
and
obligate
intracellular
bacterium
.

It
inhabits
a
host
cell
-derived
vacuole
and
cycles
between
replicative
reticulate
cell
(
RC
)
and
infectious
dense
-cored
(
DC
)
morphotypes
.

Host-pathogen
interactions
that
are
critical
for
RC-to-DC
conversion
are
undefined
.

We
previously
reported
that
A.
phagocytophilum
recruits
green
fluorescent
protein
(
GFP
)
-tagged
Rab10
,
a
GTPase
that
directs
exocytic
traffic
from
the
sphingolipid-rich
trans-Golgi
network
(
TGN
)
to
its
vacuole
in
a
guanine
nucleotide
-independent
manner
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
endogenous
Rab10
-positive
TGN
vesicles
are
not
only
routed
to
but
also
delivered
into
the
A.
phagocytophilum
-occupied
vacuole
(
ApV
)
.

Consistent
with
this
finding
,
A.
phagocytophilum
incorporates
sphingolipids
while
intracellular
and
retains
them
when
naturally
released
from
host
cells
.

TGN
vesicle
delivery
into
the
ApV
is
Rab10
dependent
,
up-regulates
expression
of
the
DC-specific
marker
,
APH1235
,
and
is
critical
for
the
production
of
infectious
progeny
.

The
A.
phagocytophilum
surface
protein
,
uridine
monophosphate
kinase
,
was
identified
as
a
guanine
nucleotide
-independent
,
Rab10-specific
ligand
.

These
data
delineate
why
Rab10
is
important
for
the
A.
phagocytophilum
infection
cycle
and
expand
the
understanding
of
the
benefits
that
exploiting
host
cell
membrane
traffic
affords
intracellular
bacterial
pathogens
.

miR-301a
promotes
intestinal
mucosal
inflammation
through
induction
of
IL-17A
and
TNF-α
in
IBD
.

OBJECTIVE
:
MicroRNA
(
miR
)
-301a
is
known
to
be
involved
in
the
tumourigenesis
and
pathogenesis
of
several
autoimmune
diseases
,
but
it
remains
unclear
whether
miR-301a
is
associated
with
the
pathogenesis
of
IBD
.

METHODS
:
miR-301a
expression
was
assessed
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
and
inflamed
mucosa
of
patients
with
IBD
by
quantitative
real-time-PCR
.

Peripheral
blood
CD4+
T
cells
were
transduced
with
lentivirus
-encoding
pre-miR-301a
(
LV-miR-301a
)
or
a
reverse
complementary
sequence
of
miR-301a
(
LV-anti-miR-301a
)
,
and
their
differentiation
and
activation
were
investigated
in
vitro
.

Antisense
miR-301a
was
administered
into
mice
during
trinitrobenzene
sulphonic
acid
(
TNBS
)
-induced
colitis
to
determine
its
role
in
colitis
.

RESULTS
:
miR-301a
expression
was
significantly
upregulated
in
PBMC
and
inflamed
mucosa
of
patients
with
IBD
compared
with
healthy
controls
.

Stimulation
with
tumour
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
significantly
enhanced
miR-301a
expression
in
IBD
CD4+
T
cells
,
which
was
markedly
reversed
by
anti-TNF-α
mAb
(
Infliximab
)
treatment
.

Transduction
of
LV-miR-301a
into
CD4+
T
cells
from
patients
with
IBD
promoted
the
Th17
cell
differentiation
and
TNF-α
production
compared
with
the
cells
with
expression
of
LV-anti-miR-301a
.

SNIP1
as
a
functional
target
of
miR-301a
was
reduced
in
miR-301a
expression
but
increased
in
LV-anti-miR-301a
expression
.

Knockdown
of
SNIP1
could
enhance
Th17
cell
differentiation
.

Furthermore
,
intracolonical
administration
of
antisense
miR-301a
in
TNBS
-induced
mouse
colitis
model
significantly
decreased
numbers
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-17A
(
+
)
cells
and
amounts
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
(
eg
,
IL-17A
,
TNF-α
)
in
inflamed
colon
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
data
reveal
a
novel
mechanism
in
which
the
elevated
miR-301a
in
PBMC
and
inflamed
mucosa
of
IBD
promotes
Th17
cell
differentiation
through
downregulation
of
SNIP1
.

Blockade
of
miR-301a
in

may
serve
as
a
novel
therapeutic
approach
in

OBJECTIVE
:
The
short

crucial
in
preserving

TSLP
deficiency
has
been
implicated
in
sustaining

DESIGN
:
TSLP
isoforms-long
and
short-and
receptors-TSLPR
and
interleukin
(

-7Rα-were
assessed
by
immunofluorescence
,

qRT-PCR
in
the
duodenum
of
untreated

The
ability
of
the
serine
protease
furin
or

supernatants
to
cleave
TSLP
was
evaluated
by

by

cultured
ex

was
also
assessed
.

RESULTS
:
Mucosal
TSLP
,
but
not
TSLPR

,
was
reduced
in

in
comparison
to

.

Transcripts
of
both
TSLP
isoforms
were
decreased
in

.

Furin
,
which
was
overexpressed
in
active
CD
biopsies
,
was
able
to
cleave
TSLP
in

.

Accordingly
,

supernatants
showed
higher
TSLP

capacity
in
comparison
to

.

In
our
ex

,
both

significantly
downregulated

:
Reduced

Further
studies
are
needed
to

whether
restoring

be
therapeutically
useful

of
BCL6-driven

lymphoma
.

Somatic
hypermutation
and
class-switch
recombination
of
the
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
genes
occur
in
germinal
center
(
GC
)
B
cells
and
are
initiated
through
deamination
of
cytidine
to
uracil
by
activation
-induced
cytidine
deaminase
(
AID
)
.

Resulting
uracil-guanine
mismatches
are
processed
by
uracil
DNA
glycosylase
(
UNG
)
-mediated
base-excision
repair
and
MSH2
-mediated
mismatch
repair
(
MMR
)
to
yield
mutations
and
DNA
strand
lesions
.

Although
off-target
AID
activity
also
contributes
to
oncogenic
point
mutations
and
chromosome
translocations
associated
with
GC
and
post-GC
B-cell
lymphomas
,
the
role
of
downstream
AID
-associated
DNA
repair
pathways
in
the
pathogenesis
of
lymphoma
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
show
that
simultaneous
deficiency
of
UNG
and
MSH2
or
MSH2
alone
causes
genomic
instability
and
a
shorter
latency
to
the
development
of
BCL6-driven
diffuse
large
B-cell
lymphoma
(
DLBCL
)
in
a
murine
model
.

The
additional
development
of
several
BCL6
-independent
malignancies
in
these
mice
underscores
the
critical
role
of
MMR
in
maintaining
general
genomic
stability
.

In
contrast
,
absence
of
UNG
alone
is
highly
protective
and
prevents
the
development
of
BCL6-driven
DLBCL
.

We
further
demonstrate
that
clonal
and
nonclonal
mutations
arise
within
non-Ig
AID
target
genes
in
the
combined
absence
of
UNG
and
MSH2
and
that
DNA
strand
lesions
arise
in
an
UNG
-dependent
manner
but
are
offset
by
MSH2
.

These
findings
lend
insight
into
a
complex
interplay
whereby
potentially
deleterious
UNG
activity
and
general
genomic
instability
are
opposed
by
the
protective
influence
of
MSH2
,
producing
a
net
protective
effect
that
promotes
immune
diversification
while
simultaneously
attenuating
malignant
transformation
of
GC
B
cells

Epigenetic
Modulation
in
Periodontitis
:
Interaction
of
Adiponectin
and
JMJD3-IRF4
Axis
in
Macrophages
.

Emerging
evidence
suggests
an
important
role
for
epigenetic
mechanisms
in
modulating
signals
during
macrophage
polarization
and
inflammation
.

JMJD3
,
a
JmjC
family
histone
demethylase
necessary
for
M2
polarization
is
also
required
for
effective
induction
of
multiple
M1
genes
by
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
.

However
,
the
effects
of
JMJD3
to
inflammation
in
the
context
of
obesity
remains
unknown
.

To
address
this
deficiency
,
we
firstly
examined
the
expression
of
JMJD3
in
macrophage
isolated
from
bone
marrow
and
adipose
tissue
of
diet
induced
obesity
(
DIO
)
mice
.

The
results
indicated
that
JMJD3
was
down
-regulated
in
obesity
.

Adiponectin
(
APN
)
,
a
factor
secreted
by
adipose
tissue
which
is
down
-regulated
in
obesity
,
functions
to
switch
macrophage
polarization
from
M1
to
M2
,
thereby
attenuating
chronic
inflammation
.

Intriguingly
,
our
results
indicated
that
APN
contributed
to
JMJD3
up-regulation
,
reduced
macrophage
infiltration
in
obese
adipose
tissue
,
and
abolished
the
up-regulation
of
JMJD3
in
peritoneal
macrophages
isolated
from
DIO
mice
when
challenged
with
Porphyromonas
gingivalis
LPS
(
pg.lps
)
.

To
elucidate
the
interaction
of
APN
and
JMJD3
involved
in
macrophage
transformation
in
the
context
of
inflammation
,
we
designed
the
loss
and
gain-function
experiments
of
APN
in
vivo
with
APN
(
-
/
-
)
mice
with
experimental
periodontitis
and
in
vitro
with
macrophage
isolated
from
APN
(
-
/
-
)
mice
.

For
the
first
time
,
we
found
that
APN
can
help
to
reduce
periodontitis
-related
bone
loss
,
modulate
JMJD3
and
IRF4
expression
,
and
macrophage
infiltration
.

Therefore
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
APN
may
contribute
to
anti-inflammation
macrophage
polarization
by
regulating
JMJD3
expression
,
which
provides
a
basis
for
macrophage
-centered
epigenetic
therapeutic
strategies

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Chronic

virus
(
HBV
)
carriers
have
a
high
risk
to
develop
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
but
the
underlying
mechanism
remains
unclear
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
viral-human
hybrid
RNA
transcripts
,
which
play
a
critical
role
in
promoting

progression
,
may
be
the
molecules
responsible
for
the
development
of
HCC
in
HBV
infected
patients
.

Here
we
determine
whether
HBx-LINE1
,
a
hybrid

and
the
HBV
-encoded
X
gene
generated
in
tumor
cells
of
HBV

,
can
serve
as
a
molecular
sponge
for
sequestering
miR-122
and
promoting
liver

.

METHODS
:
Paired
tumor
and
distal
normal
liver
tissue
specimens
,
as
well
as
HBx-LINE1
overexpressing
hepatic

,
were
used
to
test
the
relationship
between
HBx-LINE1
and
miR-122
.

Levels
of
HBx-LINE1
and
miR-122
were
assayed
by
qRT-PCR
and
Northern

.

HBx-LINE1-miR-122
binding
was
analyzed
by
luciferase

.

Mouse
hepatic

was
monitored
by
tissue
staining
and
serum
aspartate
transaminase
,
alanine
aminotransferase
and
total
bilirubin
measurement
.

RESULTS
:
HBx-LINE1
in
HBV
-positive
HCC
tissues
was
inversely
correlated
with
miR-122
.

Each
HBx-LINE1
consists
of
six
miR-122

sites
,
and
forced
expression
of
HBx-LINE1

.

Mice
administered
with
HBx-LINE1
display
a
significant
mouse

.

However
,
all
these
effects
of
HBx-LINE1
are
completely
abolished

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
finding
illustrates
a
previously

The
main
aim
of
this
study
was
to
test
the
hypothesis
whether
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
(
25OHD
)
levels
<
50
nmol
/
L
at
baseline
could
predict
statin
-induced
myopathy
during
the
course
of
treatment
.

In
addition
,
we
analysed
the
association
between
a
genetic
polymorphism
in
the
vitamin
D
receptor
(
VDR
)
and
the
risk
of
statin

.

We
used
serum
samples
from
a
prospective
,
observational
study
in
statin

patients
in
Sweden
who
were
thoroughly
followed
with
interviews

.

In
this

muscular
symptoms
and
111
had
no
muscular

associated
with

the
first
year
of

.

Patients
with
25OHD
levels
<
50

before
starting
on
statin
treatment
had
four
times
higher
risk
of
developing
muscular
symptoms
compared
with
individuals
having
25OHD
levels
>

.

The
mean
levels
of

at
baseline
were
50
±
4
nmol

Individuals
homozygous
for
the
C

in
the
VDR

had
a
four

,
95

.

In
conclusion
,
25OHD
levels
<
50
nmol
/
L
might
be
a
useful
marker
to
predict
muscular
adverse
events
during
statin
treatment
.

In
addition
,
the
finding
that
the
VDR
polymorphism
TaqI
was
associated
with
myopathy
may
indicate
a
causal
relationship
between
vitamin

and
myopathy
,

larger

an
important
causative

of
lower
respiratory

infections
in
infants
and
elderly
individuals
.

Its
fusion
(
F
)
protein
is
critical
for
virus
infection
.

It
is
targeted
by
several
investigational
antivirals
and
by
palivizumab
,
a
humanized
monoclonal
antibody
used
prophylactically
in
infants
considered
at
high
risk
of
severe
RSV
disease
.

ALX-0171
is
a
trimeric
Nanobody
that
binds
the
antigenic
site
II
of
RSV
F

with
subnanomolar

.

ALX-0171
demonstrated
in

neutralization
superior
to
that
of
palivizumab
against
prototypic
RSV
subtype

Moreover
,
ALX-0171
completely

for
87
%

Importantly
,

BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:
Infectious
mononucleosis
(
IM
)
caused
by
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
has
been
associated
with
increased
risk
of
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
.

However
,
the
mechanism
linking
these
pathologies
is
unclear
.

Different
reports
indicate
the
association
of
EBV
,
and
recently
Mycobacterium
avium
subsp.
paratuberculosis
(
MAP
)
,
with
MS
.

For
a
better
understanding
of
the
role
of
these
pathogens
,
the
host
response
induced
by
selected
antigenic
peptides
in
subjects
with
a
history
of
IM
that
significantly
increases
the
risk
of
MS
was
investigated
.

METHODS
:
Both
humoral
and
cell
-mediated
response
against
peptides
able
to
induce
a
specific
immune
activation
in
MS
patients
deriving
from
lytic
and
latent
EBV
antigens

305-320
)
,
EBNA1

400-413
)
,
from
MAP

(
18-32
)
,

)
and
from
human
proteins
IRF5
(
424-434
)
and
MBP
(
85-98
)
in
subjects
with
current
and
past
IM
were
examined
.

RESULTS
:
EBNA1
and
MAP_0106c
peptides
were
able
to
induce
a
humoral
immune
response
in
subjects
with
a
history
of
clinical
IM
in
an
independent
manner
.

Moreover
,
these
peptides
were
capable
of
inducing
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
interferon
γ
by
CD4+
and
CD8+
T
lymphocytes
and
interleukin
6

cells
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
results
highlight
that
EBV
and
MAP
may
be
involved
independently
in
the
same
causal
process
leading
to
MS
in
subjects
with
a
history
of
IM

Avian
influenza
viruses
of
subtype
H5N1
circulating
in
animals
continue
to
pose
threats
to
human
health
.

The
binding
preference
of
the
viral
surface
protein
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
to
sialosaccharides
of
receptors
is
an
important
area
for
understanding
mutations
in
the
receptor
binding
site
that
could
be
the
cause
for
avian-to-human
transmission
.

In
the
present
work
,
we
studied
the
effect
of
two
receptor
binding
site
mutations
,
S221P
singly
and
in
combination
with
another
mutation
K216E
in
the
HA
protein
of
influenza
A
H5N1
viruses
.

Docking
of
sialic
acid
ligands
corresponding
to
both
avian
and

and
molecular

simulations
of
the
complexes
for
wild
and
mutant
strains
of
H5N1
viruses
were
carried
out
.

The
H5N1
strain
possessing
the
S221P
mutation
indicated
decreased
binding
to
α2
,
3
-linked
sialic

(

,
SAα2
,

)
when
compared
to
the
binding
of
the
wild-type
strain
that
did
not
possess
the
HA-221
mutation
.

The
binding
to
α2
,
6
-linked
sialic
acids
(
human
receptor
,
SAα2
,
6Gal
)
was
found
to
be
comparable
,
indicating
that
the
mutant
strain
shows
limited
dual
receptor
specificity
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
S221P
mutation
in
synergism
with
the
K216E
mutation
in
the
binding
site
,
resulted
in
increased
binding
affinity
for
SAα2
,
6Gal
when
compared
to
SAα2
,
3Gal
,
indicative
of
enhanced
binding
to

receptors
.

The
in-depth
study
of
the
molecular
interactions
in
the
docked
complexes
could
explain
how
co
-occurring
mutations
in
the
HA
viral
protein
can
aid
in

UNLABELLED
:
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
(
KS
)
-associated
herpesvirus
(
KSHV
)
is
a
human
gammaherpesvirus
associated
with
several
human
malignancies
.

The
replication
and
transcription
activator
(
RTA
)
is
necessary
and
sufficient
for
the
switch
from
KSHV
latency
to
lytic
replication
.

Interleukin
1
(
IL-1
)
is
a
major
mediator
for
inflammation
and
plays
an
important
role
in
both
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
.

Myeloid
differentiation
primary
response
gene
88
(
MyD88
)
is
an
essential
adaptor
molecule
for
IL-1
as
well
as
most
Toll
-like
receptor
signaling
.

In
this
study
,
we
identified
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
KSHV
interferes
with
host
inflammation
and
immunity
.

KSHV
RTA
specifically
reduces
the
steady-state
protein
levels
of
MyD88
,
and
physiological
levels
of
MyD88
are
downregulated
during
KSHV
lytic
replication
when
RTA
is
expressed
.

The
N-terminal
region
of
RTA
is
required
for
the
reduction
of
MyD88
.

Additional
studies
demonstrated
that
RTA
targets
MyD88
expression
at
the
RNA
level
,
inhibits
RNA
synthesis
of
MyD88
,
and
may
bind
MyD88
RNA
.

Finally
,
RTA
inhibits
IL-1
-mediated
activation
of
NF-κB
.

Because
IL-1
is
abundant
in
the
KS
microenvironment
and
inhibits
KSHV
replication
,
this
work
may
expand
our
understanding
of
how
KSHV
evades
host
inflammation
and
immunity
for
its
survival
in
vivo
.

IMPORTANCE
:

.

This
work
shows
that
KSHV
inhibits
MyD88
expression
through
a
novel
mechanism
.

KSHV
RTA
may
bind
to
MyD88

We

like
to
identify

.

CTL

to
assess

CONCLUSION
:
In
this
study
,
we
found
that
a
prediction
pipeline
for
CTL
epitopes
might
be
based
on
the
most
popular
computer
prediction
software
and
FABS
methods
.

Our
results
suggest
that
these
CTL
epitopes
may
provide
useful
tools
and
information
for
the
development
of
a
therapeutic

Specialized
proresolving
mediators
(
SPMs
)
inhibit
human
B-cell
IgE
production
.

Specialized
proresolving
mediators
(
SPMs
)
constitute
a
recently
recognized
class
of
bioactive
molecules
thatpromote
the
resolution
of
inflammation
.

We
recently
reported
that
the
SPMs
resolvin
D1
(
RvD1
)
and
17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic
acid
(
17-HDHA
)
promote
the
differentiation
of
IgG
-secreting
B
cells
and
enhance
antibody
-mediated
immune
responses
.

However
,
there
is
an
important
knowledge
gap
regarding
whether
or
not
SPMs
regulate
human
B-cell
IgE
production
,
which
is
the
key
effector
in
diseases
such
as
asthma
and
allergy
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
whether
a
panel
of
diverse
SPMs
influences
B-cell
IgE
production
.

An
important
finding
was
that
17-HDHA
and
RvD1
inhibit
IgE
production
by
human
B
cells
and
suppress
the
differentiation
of
naïve
B
cells
into
IgE
-secreting
cells
by
specifically
blocking
epsilon
germline
transcript
.

This
effect
is
specific
to
human
IgE
,
as
the
SPMs
do
not
inhibit
production
of
IgM
and
IgG
and
did
not
suppress
other
IL-4
-upregulated
genes
.

17-HDHA
and
RvD1
act
by
stabilizing
the
transcriptional
repressor
B-cell
lymphoma
6
,
which
competes
with
STAT6
for
binding
at
the
epsilon
germline
transcript
promoter
.

Overall
,
these
new
findings
demonstrate
that
certain
SPMs
inhibit
the
differentiation
of
IgE
-producing
B
cells
,
without
being
broadly
immune
suppressive
,
representing
a
novel
class
of
potential
therapeutics
for
IgE-driven
diseases
such
as
asthma
and
allergy

In

.

We
found
that
suppression
of
Rab11
expression
caused
vRNP
aggregation
in
the
cytoplasm
and
reduced
progeny

showing
that

active
form
of
Rab11
.

Moreover
,
Rab11Q70L

These
results
highlight
the
critical

in
vRNP

,
and
suggest
a

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
Neural
stem
cells
in
each
treatment
group
were
examined
for
cell
survival
and
neuronal
differentiation
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
via
immunofluorescence
and
Western
blot
analysis
.

Axonal
regeneration
and
tissue
repair
were
assessed
via
retrograde
tracing
using
Fluorogold
,
electron
microscopy
,
hematoxylin-eosin
staining
and
MRI
.

Rats
were
also
examined
for
functional
recovery
based
on
the
measurement
of
spinal
cord
-evoked
potentials
and
the
Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan
score
.

LINGO-1-RNA
interference
-treated
neural
stem
cell
transplantation
increased
tissue
repair
and
functional
recovery
of
the
injured
spinal
cord
in
rats
.

Similarly
,
LINGO-1
RNA
interference
increased
neural
stem
cell
survival
and
neuronal
differentiation
in
vitro
.

The
mechanism
underlying
the
effect
of
LINGO-1
RNA
interference
on
the
injured
rat
spinal
cord
may
be
that
the
significant
inhibition
of
LINGO-1
expression
in
neural
stem
cells
inactivated
the
RhoA
and
Notch
signaling
pathways
,
which
act
downstream
of
LINGO-1
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
findings
indicate
that
transplantation
of
LINGO-1-RNA
interference
-treated
neural
stem
cells
facilitates
functional
recovery
after
spinal
cord
injury
and
represents
a
promising
potential
strategy
for
the
repair
of
spinal
cord
injury

Depression
,
immune
function
,
and
early
adrenarche
in
children
.

Despite
consistent
findings
of
an
association
between
depression
and
immunity
in
adult
and
adolescent
populations
,
little
is
known
about
the
nature
of
this
relationship
at
earlier
ages
.

Studies
of
children
have
yielded
mixed
results
,
suggesting
methodological
confounds
and
/
or
the
presence
of
significant
moderating
factors
.

Timing
of
adrenarche
,
the
first
phase
of
puberty
that
occurs
during
late
childhood
,
is
a
plausible
moderator
of
the
depression-immunity
relationship
in
late
childhood
due
to
its
associations
with
both
the
immune
system
and
psychological
wellbeing
.

We
hypothesized
that
:
(
1
)
a
depression-immunity
association
exists
in
children
,
(
2
)
this
association
is
moderated
by
adrenarcheal
timing
,
and
,
(
3
)
this
association
is
also
moderated
by
gender
.

Data
were
drawn
from
a
nested
study
of
103
participants
(
62
females
,
Mage=9.5
,
age
range
:
8.67-10.21
years
)
participating
in
a
population
based
cohort
study
of
the
transition
from
childhood
to
adolescence
(
across
puberty
)
.

Participants
in
this
nested
study
completed
the
Children
's
Depression
Inventory
2
(
CDI-2
)
and
provided
morning
saliva
samples
to
measure
immune
markers
(
i.e.
,
C
-reactive
protein
,
CRP
;
and
secretory
immunoglobulin
A
,
SIgA
)
.

Using
hierarchical
regression
,
inflammation
measured
by
CRP
was
positively
associated
with
the
negative
mood
/
physical
symptoms
(
NM
/
PS
)
subscale
(
β=0.23
,
t=2.33
,
p=0.022
)
of
the
CDI-2
.

A
significant
interaction
effect
of
SIgA
x
adrenarcheal
timing
was
found
for
NM
/
PS
(
β=-0.39
,
t=-2.19
,
p=0.031
)
and
Interpersonal
Problems
(
β=-0.47
,
t=-2.71
,
p=0.008
)
.

SIgA
and
NM
/
PS
were
positively
associated
for
relatively
late
developers
.

SIgA
and
Interpersonal
Problems
were
positively
associated
for
late
developers
,
and
negatively
associated
for
early
developers
.

We
suggest
that
both
sets
of
findings
might
be
partially
explained
by
the
immunosuppressive
effect
of
the
hormonal
changes
associated
with
earlier
adrenarche
,
namely
testosterone
.

These
results
also
suggest
that
adrenarcheal
timing
has
an
effect
on
the
association
between
depression
and
immunity
,
and
is
therefore
an
important
measure
in
research
with
younger
populations
.

Future
research
should
utilize
longitudinal
designs
to
demonstrate
direction
of
influence
of
variables
,
and
use
a
broader
range
of
pro-
and
anti-inflammatory
markers
.

Changes
in
different
parameters
,
lymphocyte
proliferation
and
hematopoietic
progenitor
colony
formation
in
EAE
mice
treated
with
myelin
oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein
.

Myelin
oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein
(
MOG
)
is
an
antigen
of
the
myelin
sheath
,
which
may
trigger
immune
cell
responses
and
the
production
of
auto-antibodies
in
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
MOG
(
35-55
)
-induced
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
(
EAE
)
,
a
model
of
human
MS
,
to
assess
the
production
of
catalytically
active
immunoglobulin
G
(
IgG
)
antibodies
or
abzymes
which
have
been
shown
to
be
present
in
sera
of
patients
with
several
autoimmune
diseases
.

Here
,
we
show
that
IgGs
from
the
sera
of
control
C57BL
/
6
mice
are
catalytically
inactive
.

During
development
of
EAE
,
a
specific
reorganization
of
the
immune
system
of
mice
occurred
leading
to
a
condition
which
was
associated
with
the
generation
of
catalytically
active
IgGs
hydrolysing
DNA
,
myelin
basic
protein
(
MBP
)
and
MOG
which
was
associated
with
increased
proteinuria
,
changes
in
differentiation
of
mice
bone
marrow
hematopoietic
stem
cells
(
HSCs
)
and
an
increase
in
proliferation
of
lymphocytes
in
bone
marrow
,
spleen
and
thymus
as
well
as
a
significant
suppression
of
cell
apoptosis
in
these
organs
.

The
strongest
alterations
were
found
in
the
early
disease
phase
(
18-24
days
after
immunization
)
and
were
less
pronounced
in
later
EAE
stages
(
40
days
after
EAE
induction
)
.

We
conclude
that
a
significant
increase
in
DNase
and
proteolytic
activities
of
antibodies
may
be
considered
the
earliest
statistically
significant
marker
of
MOG
-induced
EAE
in
mice
.

The
possible
differences
in
immune
system
reorganizations
during
preclinical
phases
of
the
disease
,
acute
and
late
EAE
,
leading
to
production
of
different
auto-antibodies
and
abzymes
as
well
other
changes
are
discussed
.

Culture
expanded
primary
chondrocytes
have
potent
immunomodulatory
properties
and
do
not
induce
an
allogeneic
immune
response
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Allogeneic
cell
therapies
,
such
as
mesenchymal
stromal
cells
(
MSC
)
,
which
have
potent
regenerative
and
anti-inflammatory
potential
are
being
investigated
as
a
therapy
for
osteoarthritis
(
OA
)
and
cartilage
injury
.

Here
we
describe
another
potential
source
of
regenerative
and
anti-inflammatory
allogeneic
cells
,
culture
expanded
primary
chondrocytes
(
CEPC
)
.

In
direct
comparison
to
allogeneic
MSC
,
we
extensively
assess
the
immunological
interactions
of
CEPC
in
an
allogeneic
setting
.

METHODS
:
Chondrocytes
were
isolated
from
rat
articular
cartilage
and
cultured
in
normoxic
or
hypoxic
conditions
.

In
vitro
co-culture
assays
with
allogeneic
lymphocytes
and
macrophages
were
used
to
assess
the
immunomodulatory
capacities
of
the
chondrocytes
,
followed
by
immune
response
analysis
by
flow
cytometry
,
ELISA
and
qPCR
.

RESULTS
:
CEPC
showed
reduced
induction
of
proliferation
,
activation
and
cytotoxic
granzyme
B
expression
in
allogeneic
T
cells
.

Importantly
,
exposure
to
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
did
not
increase
CEPC
immunogenicity
despite
increases
in
MHC-I
.

Furthermore
,
CEPC
had
a
potent
ability
to
suppress
allogeneic
T
cell
proliferation
,
which
was
dependent
on
nitric
oxide
production
.

This
suppression
was
contact
independent
in
hypoxia
cultured
CEPC
.

Finally
,
chondrocytes
were
shown
to
have
the
capacity
to
modulate
pro-inflammatory
macrophage
activity
by
reducing
MHC-II
expression
and
TNF-α
secretion
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
indicate
the
potential
use
of
allogeneic
chondrocytes
in
OA
and
cartilage
defects
.

The
lack
of
evident
immunogenicity
,
despite
exposure
to
a
pro-inflammatory
environment
,
coupled
with
the
immunomodulatory
ability
indicates
that
these
cells
have
the
potential
to
evade
the
host
immune
system
and
suppress
inflammation
,
thus
potentially
facilitating
the
resolution
of
OA
induced
inflammation
and
cartilage
regeneration

OBJECTIVES
:
Patients
with
systemic
lupus

SLE
)
have
an
ongoing
interferon-α
(
IFN-α
)
production
by
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
(
pDCs
)
.

We
investigated
whether
T
cells
can
promote
IFN-α
production
by
pDCs
.

METHODS
:
Human
pDCs
were
stimulated
with
immune
complexes
(
ICs
)
containing
U1
small
nuclear
ribonucleic
proteins

and
SLE-IgG

)
in
the
presence
of
T
cells
or
T
cell
supernatants
.

T
cells
were
activated
by
anti-CD3
/
CD28
antibodies
or
in
a
mixed
leucocyte
reaction
.

IFN-α
and
other
cytokines
were
determined
in
culture
supernatants
or
patient
sera
with
immunoassays
.

The
effect
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
3
and
granulocyte-macrophage-colony
-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
on
pDCs
was
examined
by
the
use
of
antibodies
,
and
the
expression
of
CD80
/
CD86
was
determined
using
flow

.

RESULTS
:
Activated
T
cells
and
supernatants
from
activated
T

increased
IFN-α
production
by
>
20-fold
.

The
stimulatory
effect
of
T
cell
supernatants
was
reduced
after
depletion
of
GM-CSF
(
81

from
6
%

,

.

Activated

T
cells
enhanced
IFN-α
production
to
the
same
extent
as
T
cells
from
healthy
individuals
and
a
subset
of
patients
with

CONCLUSIONS
:
Activated
T

enhance
IFN-α
production
by
RNA-IC
stimulated
pDCs
via
GM-CSF

Given
the
increased
serum
levels
of
GM-CSF
in
a
subset
of
patients
with
SLE
,
these
findings
suggest
that

Intracellular
Activation
of
Tenofovir
Alafenamide
and
the
Effect
of
Viral
and
Host
Protease
Inhibitors
.

Tenofovir
alafenamide
fumarate
(
TAF
)
is
an
oral
phosphonoamidate
prodrug
of
the
HIV
reverse
transcriptase
nucleotide
inhibitor
tenofovir
(
TFV
)
.

Previous
studies
suggested
a
principal
role
for
the
lysosomal
serine
protease
cathepsin
A
(
CatA
)
in
the
intracellular
activation
of
TAF
.

Here
we
further
investigated
the
role
of
CatA
and
other
human
hydrolases
in
the
metabolism
of
TAF
.

Overexpression
of
CatA
or
liver
carboxylesterase
1
(
Ces1
)
in
HEK293T
cells
increased
intracellular
TAF
hydrolysis
2-
and
5-fold
,
respectively
.

Knockdown
of
CatA
expression
with
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
in
HeLa
cells
reduced
intracellular
TAF
metabolism
5-fold
.

Additionally
,
the
anti-HIV
activity
and
the
rate
of
CatA
hydrolysis
showed
good
correlation
within
a
large
set
of
TFV
phosphonoamidate
prodrugs
.

The
covalent

)
telaprevir
and
boceprevir
potently
inhibited
CatA
-mediated
TAF
activation
(
50
%
inhibitory
concentration
[
IC50
]
=
0.27
and
0.16
μM
,
respectively
)
in

and
also
reduced
its
anti-HIV
activity
in
primary
human
CD4
(
+
)
T
lymphocytes
(
21-
and
3-fold
,
respectively
)
at
pharmacologically
relevant
concentrations
.

In
contrast
,
there
was
no
inhibition
of
CatA
or
any
significant
effect
on
anti-HIV
activity
of
TAF
observed
with
cobicistat
,
noncovalent
HIV
and
HCV
PIs
,
or
various
prescribed
inhibitors
of
host
serine
proteases
.

Collectively
,
these
studies
confirm
that
CatA
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
intracellular
metabolism
of
TAF
,
whereas
the
liver
esterase
Ces1
likely
contributes
to
the
hepatic
activation
of
TAF
.

Moreover
,
this
work
demonstrates
that
a
wide
range
of
viral
and
host
PIs
,
with
the
exception
of
telaprevir
and
boceprevir
,
do
not
interfere
with
the
antiretroviral
activity
of
TAF

over
a
4-week
period
in
a
double-blind
,
randomised

2a
study
.

Plasma

were
determined
by
qPCR
and
compared
between
patients

.

RESULTS
:
Median

miR-532-5p
compared
to
baseline
(
3.0
and
4.7-fold

)
.

However
,
subsequent
longitudinal
analysis
showed
no
significant
differences
in
miR-210
and
miR-532-5p
plasma
levels
throughout
the

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
demonstrated
a
substantial

Effect
of
LexA
on
Chromosomal
Integration
of
CTXϕ
in
Vibrio
cholerae
.

UNLABELLED
:
The
genesis
of
toxigenic
Vibrio
cholerae
involves
acquisition
of
CTXϕ
,
a
single
-stranded
DNA
(
ssDNA
)
filamentous
phage
that
encodes
cholera
toxin
(
CT
)
.

The
phage
exploits
host
-encoded
tyrosine
recombinases
(
XerC
and
XerD
)
for
chromosomal
integration
and
lysogenic
conversion
.

The
replicative
genome
of
CTXϕ
produces
ssDNA
by
rolling-circle
replication
,
which
may
be
used
either
for
virion
production
or
for
integration
into
host
chromosome
.

Fine
-tuning
of
different
ssDNA
binding
protein
(
Ssb
)
levels
in
the
host
cell
is
crucial
for
cellular
functioning
and
important
for
CTXϕ
integration
.

In
this
study
,
we
mutated
the
master
regulator
gene
of
SOS
induction
,
lexA
,
of
V.
cholerae
because
of
its
known
role
in
controlling
levels
of
Ssb
proteins
in
other
bacteria
.

CTXϕ
integration
decreased
in
cells
with
a
ΔlexA
mutation
and
increased
in
cells
with
an
SOS
-noninducing
mutation
,
lexA
(
Ind
(
-
)
)
.

We
also
observed
that
overexpression
of
host
-encoded
Ssb
(
VC0397
)
decreased
integration
of
CTXϕ
.

We
propose
that
LexA
helps
CTXϕ
integration
,
possibly
by
fine
-tuning
levels
of
host-
and
phage
-encoded
Ssbs
.

IMPORTANCE
:
Cholera
toxin
is
the
principal
virulence
factor
responsible
for
the
acute
diarrheal
disease
cholera
.

CT
is
encoded
in
the
genome
of
a
lysogenic
filamentous
phage
,
CTXϕ
.

Vibrio
cholerae
has
a
bipartite
genome
and
harbors
single
or
multiple
copies
of
CTXϕ
prophage
in
one
or
both
chromosomes
.

Two
host
-encoded
tyrosine
recombinases
(
XerC
and
XerD
)
recognize
the
folded
ssDNA
genome
of
CTXϕ
and
catalyze
its
integration
at
the
dimer
resolution
site
of
either
one
or
both
chromosomes
.

Fine
-tuning
of
ssDNA
binding
proteins
in
host
cells
is
crucial
for
CTXϕ
integration
.

We
engineered
the
V.
cholerae
genome
and
created
several
reporter
strains
carrying
ΔlexA
or
lexA
(
Ind
(
-
)
)
alleles
.

Using
the
reporter
strains
,
the
importance
of
LexA
control
of
Ssb
expression
in
the
integration
efficiency
of
CTXϕ
was
demonstrated

in
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
upon

.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Chronic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
infection
is
characterized
by
functional
impairment
of
HBV-specific
T
cells
.

Understanding
the
mechanisms
behind
T
cell
dysfunction
and
restoration
is
important
for
the
development
of
optimal
treatment
strategies
.

METHODS
:
In
this
study
we
have
first
analysed
the
phenotype
and
function
of
HBV-specific
T
cells
in
patients
with
low
viral
load
(
HBV
DNA
<
20
,
000IU
/
ml
)
and
spontaneous
control
over
the
virus
.

Subsequently
,
we
assessed
HBV-specific
T
cells
in
patients
with
high
viral
load
(
HBV
DNA
>
17
,
182IU
/
ml
)
treated
with
peginterferon
/
adefovir
combination
therapy
who
had
various
treatment
outcomes
.

RESULTS
:
HBV-specific
T
cells
could
be
detected
directly
ex
vivo
in
7
/
22
patients
with
low
viral
load
.

These
showed
an
early
differentiated
memory
phenotype
with
reduced
ability
to
produce
IL-2
and
cytotoxic
molecules
such
as
granzyme
B
and
perforin
,
but
with
strong
proliferative
potential
.

In
a
cohort
of
28
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
with
high
viral
load
treated
with
peginterferon
and
adefovir
,
HBV-specific
T
cells
could
not
be
detected
directly
ex
vivo
.

However
,
HBV-specific
T
cells
could
be
selectively
expanded
in
vitro
in
patients
with
therapy
-induced
HBsAg
clearance
(
HBsAg
loss
n=7
)
,
but
not
in
patients
without
HBsAg
clearance
(
n=21
)
.

Further
analysis
of
HBV-specific
T
cell
function
with
peptide
pools
showed
broad
and
efficient
antiviral
responses
after
therapy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
show
that
peginterferon
based
combination
therapy
can
induce
HBV-specific
T
cell
restoration
.

These
findings
may
help
to
develop
novel
therapeutic
strategies
to
reconstitute
antiviral
functions
and
enhance
viral
clearance

Diquafosol
promotes
corneal
epithelial
healing
via
intracellular
calcium
-mediated
ERK
activation
.

Diquafosol
is
known
as
a
purinergic
P2Y2
receptor
(
P2Y2R
)
agonist
that
stimulates
water
and
mucin
secretion
from
conjunctival
epithelial
cells
and
goblet
cells
,
leading
to
tear
film
stability
in
dry
eye
.

However
,
its
effect
on
corneal
epithelial
healing
has
not
yet
been
elucidated
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
diquafosol
on
corneal
epithelial
healing
in
vivo
and
on
P2Y2R
-related
downstream
signaling
pathways
in
vitro
.

We
administered
3
%
diquafosol
ophthalmic
solution
on
3
mm-diameter
epithelial
defects
made
in
rat
corneas
and
assessed
the
wound
closure
over
time
.

Corneal
epithelial
healing
was
significantly
accelerated
in
diquafosol
-treated
eyes
compared
to
control
eyes
at
12
and
24
h
.

During
wound
healing
,
P2Y2R
staining
appeared
stronger
in
the
re
-epithelized
margin
near
the
wound

were
used
for
in

experiments
.

Cell
proliferation
was
accelerated
by
diquafosol
at
concentrations
from
20
to
200
μM
during
48
h
,
but
inhibited
at
concentrations
over
2000
μM
.

The
intracellular
calcium

was
measured
in

.

[

was
observed
in
diquafosol
-stimulated
cells
regardless
of
the
presence
of
calcium
in
media
,
and
suramin
pretreatment
inhibited
the
calcium
response
.

The
effect
of
diquafosol
on
phosphorylation
of
EGFR
,
ERK
and
Akt
,
and
cell
migration
was
determined
by
western
blotting
and
in

cell
migration
assay
.

Diquafosol
induced
phosphorylation
of
EGFR
at
2
min
post-stimulation
,
and
phosphorylation
of
ERK
at
5
min
post-stimulation
.

Phosphorylation
of
ERK
was
attenuated
in
cells
pretreated
with
suramin
or
BAPTA
/
AM
(
[
Ca

chelator
)
,
and
partially
with
AG1478
(
EGFR
inhibitor
)
.

Likewise
,
diquafosol
-treated
cells
showed
acceleration
of
gap
closure
in
cell
migration
assay
,
which
was
inhibited
by
suramin
,
BAPTA
/
AM
,
AG1478
,
and
U0126
(

.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
diquafosol
is
effective
in
promoting
corneal
epithelial
wound
healing
and
that
this
effect
may
result
from

We

both
the

Transcriptomic

during

conditions
.

The
transcriptomic
responses
of
bacteria
to
environmental
stresses
have
been
studied
extensively
,
yet
we
know
little
about
how
the
stressed
cells
respond
to
bacteriophage
infection
.

Here
,
we
conducted
the
first
whole
transcriptome
sequencing
(
RNA-seq
)
study
of
stressed
bacteria
to
phage
infection
by
infecting
the
marine
picocyanobacterium
Prochlorococcus
NATL2A
with
cyanomyovirus
P-SSM2
under
P
limitation
,
a
strong
selective
force
in
the
oceans
.

Transcripts
of
the
P-acquisition
genes
in
the
uninfected
cells
were
enriched
after
P
limitation
,
including
the
high-affinity
phosphate
-binding
protein
gene
pstS
.

They
were
still
enriched
in
the
infected
cells
under
P
-limited
conditions
.

In
contrast
,
transcripts
of
adenosine
triphosphate
(
ATP
)
synthase
and
ribosomal
protein
genes
were
depleted
in
the
uninfected
cells
after
P
limitation
but
were
enriched
during
phage
infection
of
P
-starved
cells
.

Cyanophage
P-SSM2
contains
pstS
,
and
pstS
and
its
adjacent
gene
g247
of
unknown
function
were
the
only
phage
genes
that
were
enriched
under
P
-limited
conditions
.

We
further
found
that
the
host
pstS
transcript
number
per
cell
decreased
after
infection
,
however
,
it
was
still
much
higher
in
the
P
-limited
infected
cells
than
that
in
the
nutrient-replete
cells
.

Moreover
,
phage
pstS
transcript
number
per
cell
was
∼
20
times
higher
than
the
host
copy
,
which
may
help
maintain
the
host
phosphate
uptake
rate
during
infection

that

that
the

the
only
nonstructural
protein
that
enters
the
lumen
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
,
where
NS1
is
glycosylated
,
forms
a
dimer
,
and
is
subsequently
secreted
during
flavivirus
replication
as
dimers
or
hexamers
,
which
appear
to
be
highly
immunogenic
to
the
infected
host
,
as
protective
immunity
can
be
elicited
against
homologous
flavivirus
infections
.

Here
,
by
using
a
trans
-complementation
assay
,
we
identified
the
C-terminal
end
of
NS1
derived
from
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
(
JEV
)
,
which
was
more
flexible
than
other
regions
in
terms
of
housing
foreign
epitopes
without
a
significant
impact
on
virus
replication
.

This
mapped
flexible
region
is
located
in
the
conserved
tip
of
the
core
β-ladder
domain
of
the
multimeric
NS1
structure
and
is
also
known
to
contain
certain
linear
epitopes
,
readily
triggering
specific
antibody
responses
from
the
host
.

Despite
becoming
attenuated

with
insertion
of
a

epitope
derived
from

)
into
the
C-terminal
end
of
NS1
not
only
could
be
normally
released
from
infected
cells
,
but
also
induced
dual

for
the
host
to
counteract
lethal
challenge
with
either
JEV
or
EV71
in
neonatal
mice
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
secreted
multimeric
NS1
of
flaviviruses
may
serve
as
a
natural
protein
carrier
to
render
epitopes
of
interest
more
immunogenic
in
the
C
terminus
of
the
core

domain
.

IMPORTANCE
:
The
positive-sense
RNA
genomes
of
mosquito-borne
flaviviruses
appear
to
be
flexible
in
terms
of
accommodating
extra
insertions
of
short
heterologous
antigens
into
their
virus
genes
.

Here
,
we
illustrate
that
the
newly
identified
C
terminus
of
the
core
β-ladder
domain
in
NS1
could
be
readily
inserted
into
entities
such
as
EV71
epitopes
,
and
the
resulting
NS1-epitope
fusion
proteins
appeared
to
maintain
normal
virus
replication
,
secretion
ability
,
and
multimeric
formation
from
infected
cells
.

Nonetheless
,
such
an
insertion
attenuated
the
recombinant
JEV
in
mice
,
despite
having
retained
the
brain
replication
ability
observed
in
wild-type
JEV
.

that
protected
the

.

Together
,
our
results
implied
a
potential
application
of

as
a

Integrity
.

In
view
of
its
profound
effect
on
cell
survival
and
function
,
the
modulation
of
the
ubiquitin-proteasome-system
has
recently
been
shown
to
promote
neurological
recovery
and
brain
remodeling
after
focal
cerebral
ischemia
.

Hitherto
,
local
intracerebral
delivery
strategies
were
used
,
which
can
hardly
be
translated
to
human
patients
.

We
herein
analyzed
effects
of
systemic
intraperitoneal
delivery
of
the
proteasome
inhibitor
BSc2118
on
neurological
recovery
,
brain
injury
,
peripheral
and
cerebral
immune
responses
,
neurovascular
integrity
,
as
well
as
cerebral
neurogenesis
and
angiogenesis
in
a
mouse
model
of
transient
intraluminal
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
.

Systemic
delivery
of
BSc2118
induced
acute
neuroprotection
reflected
by
reduced
infarct
volume
when
delivered
up
to
9
h
post-stroke
.

The
latter
was
associated
with
reduced
brain
edema
and
stabilization
of
blood-brain-barrier
integrity
,
albeit
cerebral
proteasome
activity
was
only
mildly
reduced
.

Neuronal
survival
persisted
in
the
post-acute
stroke
phase
up
to
28
days
post-stroke
and
was
associated
with
improved
neurological
recovery
when
the
proteasome
inhibitor
was
continuously
delivered
over
7
days
.

Systemic
proteasome
inhibition
prevented
stroke
-induced
acute
leukocytosis
in
peripheral
blood
and
reversed
the
subsequent
immunosuppression
,
namely
,
the
reduction
of
blood
lymphocyte
and
granulocyte
counts
.

On
the
contrary
,
post-ischemic
brain
inflammation
,
cerebral
HIF-1α
abundance
,
cell
proliferation
,
neurogenesis
,
and
angiogenesis
were
not
influenced
by
the
proteasome
inhibitor
.

The
modulation
of
peripheral
immune
responses
might
thus
represent
an
attractive
target
for
the
clinical
translation
of
proteasome
inhibitors

METHODS
:
We
followed
983
children
in

.

Symptoms

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
findings
suggest
that
the
chromosome
17q21
locus
relates
to
episodes
of
acute
airway
obstruction
common
to
both
transient
wheeze
and
asthma
.

The
previously
identified
asthma
risk
alleles
are
the
ones
susceptible
to
environmental
influences
.

Thus
,
this
gene
-environment
interaction
reveals
two
faces
of
17q21
:
The
same
genotype
constitutes
genetic
risk
and
allows
for
environmental
protection
,
thereby
providing
options
for
prospective
prevention
strategies

the

∼25

However

we
also
found
that
when
the
F3

were
challenged
with

and
the

copy

was
maintained
at
a
high

.

We
therefore
conclude
that
although
the
MSTN

had
a
larger

Cultures
.

UNLABELLED
:
All
live
attenuated
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
vaccines
that
have
advanced
to
clinical
trials
have
been
produced
in
Vero
cells
.

The
attachment
(
G
)
glycoprotein
in
virions
produced
in
these
cells
is
smaller
than
that
produced
in
other
immortalized
cells
due
to
cleavage
.

These
virions
are
5-fold
less
infectious
for
primary
well
-differentiated
human
airway
epithelial
(
HAE
)
cell
cultures
.

Because
HAE
cells
are
isolated
directly
from
human
airways
,
Vero
cell-grown
vaccine
virus
would
very
likely
be
similarly
inefficient
at
initiating
infection
of
the
nasal
epithelium
following
vaccination
,
and
therefore
,
a
larger
inoculum
would
be
required
for
effective
vaccination
.

We
hypothesized
that
Vero
cell
-derived
virus
containing
an
intact
G
protein
would
be
more
infectious
for
HAE
cell
cultures
.

Using
protease
inhibitors
with
increasing
specificity
,
we
identified
cathepsin
L
to
be
the
protease
responsible
for
cleavage
.

Our
evidence
suggests
that
cleavage
occurs
in
the
late
endosome
or
lysosome
during
endocytic
recycling
.

Cathepsin
L
activity
was
100-fold
greater
in
Vero
cells
than
in
HeLa
cells
.

In
addition
,
cathepsin
L
was
able
to
cleave
the
G
protein
in
Vero
cell-grown
virions
but
not
in
HeLa
cell-grown
virions
,
suggesting
a
difference
in
G-protein
posttranslational
modification
in
the
two
cell
lines
.

We
identified
by
mutagenesis
amino
acids
important
for
cleavage
,
and
these
amino
acids
included
a
likely
cathepsin
L
cleavage
site
.

Virus
containing
a
modified
,
noncleavable
G
protein
produced
in
Vero
cells
was
5-fold
more
infectious
for
HAE
cells
in
culture
,
confirming
our
hypothesis
and
indicating
the
value
of
including
such
a
mutation
in
future
live
attenuated
RSV
vaccines
.

IMPORTANCE
:
Worldwide
,
RSV
is
the
second
leading
infectious
cause
of
infant
death
,
but
no
vaccine
is
available
.

Experimental
live
attenuated
RSV
vaccines
are
grown
in
Vero
cells
,
but
during
production
the
virion
attachment
(
G
)
glycoprotein
is
cleaved
.

Virions
containing
a
cleaved
G
protein
are
less
infectious
for
primary
airway
epithelial
cells
,
the
natural
RSV
target
.

In
the
study
described
here
we
identified
the
protease
responsible
,
located
the
cleavage
site
,
and
demonstrated
that
cleavage
likely
occurs
during
endocytic
recycling
.

Moreover
,
we
showed
that
the
infectivity
of
Vero
cell
-derived
virus
for
primary
airway
epithelial
cells
is
increased
5-fold
if
the
virus
contains
a
mutation
in
the
G
protein
that
prevents
cleavage
.

The
blocking
of
cleavage
should
improve
RSV
vaccine
yield
,
consequently
reducing
production
costs
.

Posttranslational
cleavage
of
the
fusion
glycoprotein
of
many
viruses
plays
an
essential
role
in
activation
;
however
,
cleavage
of
the
RSV
G
protein
is
a
novel
example
of
a
detrimental
effect
of
cleavage
on
virus
infectivity
.

Targeting
of
heme
oxygenase-1
as
a
novel
immune
regulator
of
neuroblastoma
.

Heme
oxygenase
(
HO
)
-1
catalyzes
the
degradation
of
cytotoxic
heme
into
biliverdin
and
blocks
antitumor
immune
responses
,
thus
protecting
cancer
against
host
defense
.

Whether
this
scenario
also
applies
to
neuroblastoma
(
NB
)
,
the
most
common
extracranial
solid
childhood
tumor
,
is
not
known
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
a
prognostic
relevance
of
HO-1
expression
in
samples
from
NB
patients
and
show
that
targeting
of
HO-1
prevents
both
cancer
resistance
against
cellular
stress
and
immune
escape
in
the
syngeneic
NXS2
A
/
J
mouse
model
of
NB
.

High
HO-1
RNA
expression
in
NB
tissues
emerged
as
unfavorable
prognostic
marker
,
in
particular
for
patients
older
than
18
months
as
indicated
by
univariate
as
well
as
multivariate
survival
probability
analyses
including
disease
stage
and
MYCN
status
.

On
the
basis
of
this
observation
we
aimed
to
target
HO-1
by
systemic
as
well
as
tumor-specific
zinc
protoporphyrin
-mediated
HO-1
suppression
in
a
syngeneic
immunocompetent
NB
mouse
model
.

This
resulted
in
50
%
reduction
of
primary
tumor
growth
and
a
suppression
of
spontaneous
liver
metastases
.

Importantly
,
HO-1
inhibition
abrogated
immune
cell
paralysis
affecting
CD4
and
CD8
T-effector
cells
.

This
in
turn
reverted
HO-1
-dependent
immune
escape
mechanisms
in
NB
by
increasing
NB
apoptosis
and
improved
DC
maturation
.

In
summary
,
HO-1
emerges
as
a
novel
immune
regulator
in
NB
and
emerges
as
a
promising
target
for
the
development
of
therapeutic
approaches

on

through

Recent
clinical
data
indicate
a
synergistic
therapeutic
effect
between
trastuzumab
and
taxanes
in
neoadjuvantly
treated
HER2
-positive
breast

(
BC
)
patients
.

In
HER2+
BC
experimental
models
and
patients
,
we
investigated
whether
this
synergy
depends
on
the
ability
of
drug
-induced
stress
to
improve
NK
cell
effectiveness
and
thus
trastuzumab
-mediated
ADCC
.

HER2+
BC
cell
lines
BT474
and
MDAMB361
treated
with
docetaxel
showed
up-modulation
of
NK
activator
ligands
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
accompanied
by
a
15-40
%
increase
in
in
vitro
trastuzumab
-mediated
ADCC
;
antibodies
blocking
the
NKG2D
receptor
significantly
reduced
this
enhancement
.

NKG2D
receptor
expression
was
increased
by
docetaxel
treatment
in
circulating
and
splenic
NK
cells
from
mice
xenografted
with
tumor
cells
,
an
increase
related
to
expansion
of
the
CD11b
+
Ly6G+
cell
population
.

Accordingly
,
NK
cells
derived
from
HER2+
BC
patients
after
treatment
with
taxane
-containing
therapy
expressed
higher
levels
of
NKG2D
receptor
than
before
treatment
.

Moreover
,
plasma
obtained
from
these
patients
recapitulated
the
modulation
of
NKG2D
on
healthy
donors'NK
cells
,
improving
their
trastuzumab
-mediated
activity
in
vitro
.

This
enhancement
occurred
mainly
using
plasma
from
patients
with
low
NKG2D
basal
expression
.

Our
results
indicate
that
taxanes
increase
tumor
susceptibility
to
ADCC
by
acting
on
tumor
and
NK
cells
,
and
suggest
that
taxanes
concomitantly
administered
with
trastuzumab
could
maximize
the
antibody
effect
,
especially
in
patients
with
low
basal
immune
effector
cytotoxic
activity

Highly

entrain

cells
to
suppress
antitumor
lymphocyte
responses
.

Circulating
myeloid
-derived
suppressor
cells
(
MDSC
)
constitute
the
bulk
of
monocytic
immunosuppressive
activity
in
late-stage
melanoma
patients
.

Previous
studies
revealed
that
monocyte
-derived
macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(
MIF
)
is
necessary
for
the
immunosuppressive
function
of
tumor
-associated
macrophages
and
MDSCs
in
mouse
models
of
melanoma
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
MIF
contributes
to
human
melanoma
MDSC
induction
and
T-cell
immunosuppression
using
melanoma
patient
-derived
MDSCs
and
an
ex
vivo
coculture
model
of
human
melanoma
-induced
MDSC
.

We
now
report
that
circulating
MDSCs
isolated
from
late-stage
melanoma
patients
are
reliant
upon
MIF
for
suppression
of
antigen
-independent
T-cell
activation
and
that
MIF
is
necessary
for
maximal
reactive
oxygen
species
generation
in
these
cells
.

Moreover
,
inhibition
of
MIF
results
in
a
functional
reversion
from
immunosuppressive
MDSC
to
an
immunostimulatory
dendritic
cell
(
DC
)
-like
phenotype
that
is
at
least
partly
due
to
reductions
in
MDSC
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
.

These
findings
indicate
that
monocyte
-derived
MIF
is
centrally
involved
in
human
monocytic
MDSC
induction
/
immunosuppressive
function
and
that
therapeutic
targeting
of
MIF
may
provide
a
novel
means
of
inducing
antitumor

The
role

These

shown
to
be
mediated
through

Artemether
produced
increased
levels

The

activated

by
increasing
nuclear
translocation
of
Nrf2
and
its
binding
to

elements
in

.

Transfection
of

resulted
in
the
loss
of
both
anti-inflammatory

neuroprotective
activities

artemether

We
conclude
that
artemether
induces
Nrf2
expression

suggest
that
Nrf2
mediates
the
anti-inflammatory
effect

after
in
vitro
incubation
without
exerting
toxic
effects
.

Unlike
previously
reported
stem
cell-specific
dyes
,
CDy1
was
also
useful
for
enrichment
of
SSCs
in
both
GS
cell
culture
and
mature
adult
testes
.

Spermatogonial
transplantation
showed
that
∼1
in
66.7
cells
exhibited
SSC
activity
after
CDH1
-based
magnetic
cell
selection
and
CDy1
staining
.

In
contrast
,
although
Rh123
was
previously
used
successfully
to
collect
SSCs
from
cryptorchid
testes
,
it
was
not
possible
to
recover
SSCs
from
both
GS
cell
cultures
and
wild-type
testes
.

Thus
,
CDy1
staining
will
provide
a
useful
strategy
for
the
enrichment
of
SSCs
and
may
be
used
in
conjunction
with
other
reagents
for
the
enrichment
of
SSCs
.

Disparity
of
basal
and
therapeutically
activated
interferon
signalling
in
constraining
hepatitis
E
virus
infection
.

Hepatitis
E
virus
(
HEV
)
represents
one
of
the
foremost
causes
of
acute
hepatitis
globally
.

Although
there
is
no
proven
medication
for
hepatitis
E
,
pegylated
interferon-α
(
IFN-α
)
has
been
used
as
off-label
drug
for
treating
HEV
.

However
,
the
efficacy
and
molecular
mechanisms
of
how
IFN
signalling
interacts
with
HEV
remain
undefined
.

As
IFN-α
has
been
approved
for
treating
chronic
hepatitis
C
(
HCV
)
for
decades
and
the
role
of
interferon
signalling
has
been
well
studied
in
HCV
infection
,
this
study
aimed
to
comprehensively
investigate
virus-host
interactions
in
HEV
infection
with
focusing
on
the
IFN
signalling
,
in
comparison
with
HCV
infection
.

A
comprehensive
screen
of
human
cytokines
and
chemokines
revealed
that
IFN-α
was
the
sole
humoral
factor
inhibiting
HEV
replication
.

IFN-α
treatment
exerted
a
rapid
and
potent
antiviral
activity
against
HCV
,
whereas
it
had
moderate
and
delayed
anti-HEV
effects
in
vitro
and
in
patients
.

Surprisingly
,
blocking
the
basal
IFN
pathway
by
inhibiting
JAK1
to
phosphorylate
STAT1
has
resulted
in
drastic
facilitation
of
HEV
,
but
not
HCV
infection
.

Gene
silencing
of
the
key
components
of
JAK-STAT
cascade
of
the
IFN
signalling
,
including
JAK1
,
STAT1
and
interferon
regulatory
factor
9
(
IRF9
)
,
stimulated
HEV
infection
.

In
conclusion
,
compared
to
HCV
,
HEV
is
less
sensitive
to
IFN
treatment
.

In
contrast
,
the
basal
IFN
cascade
could
effectively
restrict
HEV
infection
.

This
bears
significant
implications
in
management
of
HEV
patients
and
future
therapeutic
development
.

Expression

of
two
cathepsin
S
in
channel
catfish
(
Ictalurus
punctatus
)
mucosal
tissues
following
bacterial
challenge
.

Cathepsin
S
belongs
to
the
papain
family
of
cysteine
protease
,
and
is
considered
to
play
key
roles
in
immune
responses
after
bacterial
challenge
.

However
,
despite
the
recognized
importance
of
Cathepsin
S
in
immunity
,
no
studies
have
systematically
characterized
Cathepsin
S
in
catfish
.

In
this
regard
,
here
,
we
characterized
the
Cathepsin
S
gene
family
in
channel
catfish
,
and
investigated
their
expression
patterns
following
two
different
Gram
-negative
bacterial
challenge
.

In
the
present
study
,
two
Cathepsin
S
genes
(
ctss
and
ctssa
)
were
captured
in
channel
catfish
.

In
comparison
to
other
species
,
the
catfish
Cathepsin
S
genes
are
highly
conserved
in
their
structural
features
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
indicated
the
strongest
phylogenetic
relationship
with
zebrafish
,
which
is
consistent
with
their
evolutional
relationships
.

Tissue
distribution
analysis
revealed
that
Cathepsin
S
genes
were
ubiquitously
expressed
in
catfish
tissues
.

Following
bacterial
infection
,
the
Cathepsin
S
genes
were
significantly
up
-regulated
at
most
time-points
in
mucosal
surfaces
,
with
an
acute
response
post
Edwardsiella
ictaluri
infection
.

Obviously
,
the
expression
profiles
were
quite
distinct
between
two
Cathepsin
S
genes
,
across
the
tissues
and
between
pathogens
,
suggesting
that
Cathepsin
S
genes
may
exert
disparate
roles
in
mucosal
immune
responses
.

Our
findings
here
,
provide
early
insight
into
the
immune
functions
of
Cathepsin
S
in
catfish
;
however
,
further
studies
are
needed
to
determine
the
mechanisms
of
Cathepsin
S
for
antigen
presentation
during
inflammatory
processes
and
innate
host
defense

Identification
of
novel
biomarkers
in
chronic
immune
thrombocytopenia
(
ITP
)
by
microarray
-based
serum
protein
profiling
.

The
pathological
mechanisms
underlying
the
development
of
immune
thrombocytopenia
(
ITP
)
are
unclear
and
its
diagnosis
remains
a
process
of
exclusion
.

Currently
,
there
are
no
known
specific
biomarkers
for
ITP
to
support
differential
diagnosis
and
treatment
decisions
.

Profiling
of
serum
proteins
may
be
valuable
for
identifying
such
biomarkers
.

Sera
from
46
patients
with
primary
chronic
ITP
and
34
healthy
blood
donors
were
analysed
using
a
microarray
of
755
antibodies
.

We
identified
161
differentially
expressed
proteins
.

In
addition
to
oncoproteins
and
tumour-suppressor
proteins
,
including
apoptosis
regulator
BCL2
,
breast
cancer
type
1
susceptibility
protein
(
BRCA1
)
,
Fanconi
anaemia
complementation
group
C
(
FANCC
)
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
A
(
VEGFA
)
,
we
detected
six
anti-nuclear
autoantibodies
in
a
subset
of
ITP
patients
:
anti-PCNA
,
anti-SmD
,
anti-Ro
/
SSA60
,
anti-Ro
/
SSA52
,
anti-La
/
SSB
and
anti-RNPC
antibodies
.

This
finding
may
provide
a
rational
explanation
for
the
association
of
ITP
with
malignancies
and
other
autoimmune
diseases
.

While
RUNX1mRNA
expression
in
the
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
of
patients
was
significantly
downregulated
,
an
accumulation
of
RUNX1
protein
was
observed
in
the
platelets
of
ITP
patients
.

This
may
indicate
dysregulation
of
RUNX1
expression
in
PBMC
and
megakaryocytes
and
may
lead
to
an
imbalanced
immune
response
and
impaired
thrombopoiesis
.

In
conclusion
,
we
provide
novel
insights
into
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
ITP
that
warrant
further
exploration
.

Apelin
:
an
antithrombotic
factor
that
inhibits
platelet
function
.

Apelin
peptide
and
its
receptor
APJ
are
directly
implicated
in
various
physiological
processes
ranging
from
cardiovascular
homeostasis
to
immune
signaling
.

Here
,
we
show
that
apelin
is
a
key
player
in
hemostasis
with
an
ability
to
inhibit
thrombin-
and
collagen
-mediated
platelet
activation
.

Mice
lacking
apelin
displayed
a
shorter
bleeding
time
and
a
prothrombotic
profile
.

Their
platelets
exhibited
increased
adhesion
and
a
reduced
occlusion
time
in
venules
,
and
displayed
a
higher
aggregation
rate
after
their
activation
by
thrombin
compared
with
wild-type
platelets
.

Consequently
,
human
and
mouse
platelets
express
apelin
and
its
receptor
APJ
.

Apelin
directly
interferes
with
thrombin
-mediated
signaling
pathways
and
platelet
activation
,
secretion
,
and
aggregation
,
but
not
with
ADP
and
thromboxane
A2
-mediated
pathways
.

IV
apelin
administration
induced
excessive
bleeding
and
prevented
thrombosis
in
mice
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
apelin
and
/
or
APJ
agonists
could
potentially
be
useful
adducts
in
antiplatelet
therapies
and
may
provide
a
promising
perspective
for
patients
who
continue
to
display
adverse
thrombotic
events
with
current
antiplatelet
therapies

Synergistic
antitumor

with

inhibition
and

in
a
murine
glioma
model
.

OBJECT
Indoleamine
2
,
3-dioxygenase
(
IDO
)
,
a
key
enzyme
of
tryptophan
(
Trp
)
metabolism
,
is
involved
in
tumor
-derived
immune
suppression
through
depletion
of
Trp
and
accumulation
of
the
metabolite
kynurenine
,
resulting
in
inactivation
of
natural
killer
cells
and
generation
of
regulatory
T
cells
(
Tregs
)
.

It
has
been
reported
that
high
expression
of
IDO
in
cancer
cells
is
associated
with
suppression
of
the
antitumor
immune
response
and
is
consistent
with
a
poor
prognosis
.

Thus
,
IDO
may
be
a
therapeutic
target
for
malignant
cancer
.

The
authors
have
recently
shown
that
IDO
expression
is
markedly
increased
in
human
glioblastoma
and
secondary
glioblastoma
with
malignant
change
,
suggesting
that
IDO
targeting
may
also
have
therapeutic
potential
for
patients
with
glioma
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
antitumor
effect
of
IDO
inhibition
and
to
examine
the
synergistic
function
of
IDO
inhibitor
and
temozolomide
(
TMZ
)
in
a
murine
glioma
model
.

METHODS
Murine
glioma
GL261
cells
and
human
glioma
U87
cells
were
included
in
this
study
.

The
authors
used
3
mouse
models
to
study
glioma
cell
growth
:
1
)
a
subcutaneous
ectopic
model
,
2
)
a
syngeneic
intracranial
orthotopic
model
,
and
3
)
an
allogenic
intracranial
orthotopic
model
.

IDO
inhibition
was
achieved
via
knockdown
of
IDO
in
GL261
cells
using
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
and
through
oral
administration
of
the
IDO
inhibitor
,
1-methyl-l-tryptophan
(
1-MT
)
.

Tumor
volume
in
the
subcutaneous
model
and
survival
time
in
the
intracranial
model
were
evaluated
.

RESULTS
In
the
subcutaneous
model
,
oral
administration
of
1-MT
significantly
suppressed
tumor
growth
,
and
synergistic
antitumor
effects
of
1-MT
and
TMZ
were
observed
(
p
<
0.01
)
.

Mice
containing
intracranially
inoculated
IDO
knockdown
cells
had
a
significantly
longer
survival
period
as
compared
with
control
mice
(
p
<
0.01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
These
results
suggest
that
IDO
expression
is
implicated
in
immunosuppression
and
tumor
progression
in
glioma
cells
.

Therefore
,
combining
IDO
inhibition
with
standard
TMZ
treatment
could
be
an
encouraging
therapeutic
strategy
for
patients
with
malignant
glioma

Influenza
A

Replication
.

UNLABELLED
:
Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
affects
the
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tracts
and
rapidly
induces
the
expression
of
mucins
,
which
are
common
O
-glycosylated
proteins
,
on
the
epithelial
surfaces
of
the
respiratory
tract
.

Although
mucin
production
is
associated
with
the
inhibition
of
virus
transmission
as
well
as
characteristic
clinical
symptoms
,
little
is
known
regarding
how
mucins
are
produced
on
the
surfaces
of
respiratory
epithelial
cells
and
how
they
affect
IAV
replication
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
two
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
,
miR-17-3p
and
miR-221
,
which
target
GalNAc
transferase
3
(
GALNT3
)
mRNA
,
are
rapidly
downregulated
in
human
alveolar
basal
epithelial
cells
during
the
early
stage
of
IAV
infection
.

We
demonstrated
that
the
expression
of
GALNT3
mRNA
is
upregulated
in
an
IAV
replication
-dependent
fashion
and
leads
to
mucin
production
in
bronchial
epithelial
cells
.

A
lectin
microarray
analysis
revealed
that
the
stable
expression
of
GALNT3
by
human
alveolar
basal
epithelial
cells
induces
mucin-type
O-glycosylation
modifications
similar
to
those
present
in
IAV
-infected
cells
,
suggesting
that
GALNT3
promotes
mucin-type
O
-linked
glycosylation
in
IAV
-infected
cells
.

Notably
,
analyses
using
short
interfering
RNAs
and
miRNA
mimics
showed
that
GALNT3
knockdown
significantly
reduces
IAV
replication
.

Furthermore
,
IAV
replication
was
markedly
decreased
in
embryonic
fibroblast
cells
obtained
from
galnt3-knockout
mice
.

Interestingly
,
IAV
-infected
galnt3-knockout
mice
exhibited
high
mortality
and
severe
pathological
alterations
in
the
lungs
compared
to
those
of
wild-type
mice
.

Our
results
demonstrate
not
only
the
molecular
mechanism
underlying
rapid
mucin
production
during
IAV
infection
but
also
the
contribution
of
O
-linked
glycosylation
to
the
replication
and
propagation
of
IAV
in
lung
cells
.

IMPORTANCE
:
Viral
infections
that
affect
the
upper
or
lower
respiratory
tracts
,
such
as
IAV
,
rapidly
induce
mucin
production
on
the
epithelial
surfaces
of
respiratory
cells
.

However
,
the
details
of
how
mucin-type
O
-linked
glycosylation
is
initiated
by
IAV
infection
and
how
mucin
production
affects
viral
replication
have
not
yet
been
elucidated
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
levels
of
two
miRNAs
that
target
the
UDP-GalNAc
transferase
GALNT3
are
markedly
decreased
during
the
early
stage
of
IAV
infection
,
resulting
in
the
upregulation
of
GALNT3
mRNA
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
the
expression
of
GALNT3
initiates
mucin
production
and
affects
IAV
replication
in
infected
cells
.

This
is
the
first
report
demonstrating
the
mechanism
underlying
the
miRNA
-mediated
initiation
of
mucin-type
O-glycosylation
in
IAV
-infected
cells
and
its
role
in
viral
replication
.

Our
results
have
broad
implications
for
understanding
IAV

OBJECTIVE
:
There
is
substantial
inter-individual
diversity
in
the
susceptibility
of
alcoholics
to
liver
injury
.

Alterations
of
intestinal
microbiota
(
IM
)
have
been
reported
in
alcoholic
liver
disease
(
ALD
)
,
but
the
extent
to
which
they
are
merely
a
consequence
or
a
cause
is
unknown
.

We
aimed
to
demonstrate
that
a
specific
dysbiosis
contributes
to
the
development
of
alcoholic
hepatitis
(
AH
)
.

DESIGN
:
We
humanised
germ-free
and
conventional
mice
using
human
IM
transplant
from
alcoholic
patients
with
or
without
AH
.

The
consequences
on
alcohol
-fed
recipient
mice
were
studied
.

RESULTS
:
A
specific
dysbiosis
was
associated
with
ALD
severity
in
patients
.

Mice
harbouring
the
IM
from
a
patient
with
severe
AH
(
sAH
)
developed
more
severe
liver
inflammation
with
an
increased
number
of
liver
T
lymphocyte
subsets
and
Natural
Killer
T
(
NKT
)
lymphocytes
,
higher
liver
necrosis
,
greater
intestinal
permeability
and
higher
translocation
of
bacteria
than
mice
harbouring
the
IM
from
an
alcoholic
patient
without
AH
(
noAH
)
.

Similarly
,
CD45+
lymphocyte
subsets
were
increased
in
visceral
adipose
tissue
,
and
CD4
(
+
)
T
and
NKT
lymphocytes
in
mesenteric
lymph
nodes
.

The
IM
associated
with
sAH
and
noAH
could
be
distinguished
by
differences
in
bacterial
abundance
and
composition
.

Key
deleterious
species
were
associated
with
sAH
while
the
Faecalibacterium
genus
was
associated
with
noAH
.

Ursodeoxycholic
acid
was
more
abundant
in
faeces
from
noAH
mice
.

Additionally
,
in
conventional
mice
humanised
with
the
IM
from
an
sAH
patient
,
a
second
subsequent
transfer
of
IM
from
an
noAH
patient
improved
alcohol
-induced
liver
lesions
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Individual
susceptibility
to
ALD
is
substantially
driven
by
IM
.

It
may
,
therefore
,
be
possible
to
prevent
and
manage
ALD
by
IM
manipulation

CONCLUSION
:
Our

)
infection
,
remaining
all
life

considered
the
most
important

carbon
nanotubes
recovered
by
hyaluronic

platform
to
detect
the
anti-HBc
.

All
the
steps
of
electrode
surface
modification
were
characterized
by
Scanning
Electronic
Microscopy
and
extensively
evaluated
by
electrochemical
techniques
.

The
electrode
response
was
measured
by
direct
anti-HBc
antigen
interactions
by
square

anodic
peak
current
which
was
proportional
to
the
anti-HBs

The
immunosensor
response
was
linear
toward
anti-HBc
in
concentrations
up
to
6
ng

)
,
with
a
detection
limit
of
0.03

.

The
linear
range
achieved
was
according
to

indicating
the
immunosensor
as
promising
tool
for

The
enhancement
of

:
The

)
were
collected
and
analyzed
from
a
subset
of
vaccinees
to
assess
CMI
responses
using
IFN-γ
and
granzyme

ELISPOT
assays
.

Cytokine
measurements
were
performed
on
PBMC

after
stimulation
with
H5N1
virus
.

RESULTS
:
PBMCs
were
available
from
177
participants
;
88
and
89
received
15-mcg
and
90-mcg
of
unadjuvanted

the
post-vaccination
timepoints
compared
to
baseline
in
pooled
analyses
of
all
vaccine
doses
and
age
groups
.

Clade

stimulation
resulted
in
statistically
significant
increased
numbers
of
IFN-γ

only
180
days
following
the
last
vaccination
.

Responses
were
similar
among
younger
and
older
study
participants
,
as
were
responses
among
those
primed
with
alum
-adjuvanted
or
non

vaccines
.

The
dosage
of
clade
2
vaccine
did
not
impact
CMI
responses
among
primed
subjects
,
but
responses
were
statistically
significantly
greater
in
unprimed
recipients
of
the
90-mcg
dosage
compared
to

of
the
15-mcg

.

IFN-γ
levels
in
the
supernatants
of

.

This
condition
mostly
occurs
after
major
orthopedic
surgery
,
implying
that
surgery
itself
could
trigger
this
immune
response
,
although
the
mechanism
is
unclear
.

To
investigate
how
surgery
may
do
so
,
we
performed
a
multicenter
,
prospective
study
of
2069
patients
who
underwent
total
knee
arthroplasty
(

.

Approximately
half
of
the
patients
received
postoperative
thromboprophylaxis
with
UFH

The
other
half
received
only

before
and
10
days
after

using
an

.

Multivariate
analysis
revealed
that
dynamic
mechanical
thromboprophylaxis
(

)
was
an
independent
risk
factor
for

For

,
the
seroconversion
rates
in
patients
treated
with
DMT
but
no
anticoagulation
and
in
patients
treated
with

without
DMT
were
similar
,
but
significantly
higher
than
in
patients
treated
with
only
GCSs
.

The
proportion
of
patients
with
≥1.4
optical
density
units
appeared
to
be
higher
among
those
treated
with
any
anticoagulant
plus
DMT
than
among
those
not
treated
with
DMT
.

Our
study
suggests
that
DMT
increases
risk
of
an
anti-PF4

acute
spinal

injury
in
rats
.

Spinal
cord
injury
(
SCI
)
is
a
debilitating
condition
with
neurological
deficits
and
loss
of
motor
function
that
,
depending
on
the
severity
,
may
lead
to
paralysis
.

The
only
treatment
currently
available
is
methylprednisolone
,
which
is
widely
used
and
renders
limited
efficacy
in
SCI
.

Therefore
,
other
therapeutic
agents
must
be
developed
.

The
neuroprotective
efficacy
of
estrogen
in
SCI
was
studied
with
a
pre-clinical
and
pro-translational
perspective
.

Acute
SCI
was
induced
in
rats
that
were
treated
with
low
doses
of
estrogen
(
1
,
5
,
10
,
or
100
μg

)
and
compared
with

,
calpain
,

)
,
apoptosis
of
neurons
in
SCI
,
and
cell
death
were
monitored
via
Western

and
immunohistochemistry
.

Negligible
pro-inflammatory
responses
or
proteolytic
events
and
very
low
levels
of
neuronal
death
were
found
in
sham

high
levels
of

regions
of
the
injured
spinal
cord
.

Estrogen
treatment
at
each
dose
reduced
pro-inflammatory
and
proteolytic
activities
and
protected
neurons
in
the
caudal
penumbra
in
acute
SCI
.

Estrogen
treatment
at
10
μg
was
found
to
be
as
effective
as
100
μg
in
ameliorating
the
above
parameters
in
injured
animals
.

Results
from
this
investigation
indicated
that
estrogen
at
a
low
dose
could
be
a
promising
therapeutic
agent
for
treating
acute
SCI
.

Experimental
studies
with
low
dose
estrogen
therapy
in
acute
spinal
cord
injury
(
SCI
)
demonstrated
the
potential
for
multi
-active
beneficial
outcomes
.

Estrogen
has
been
found
to
ameliorate
several
degenerative
pathways
following
SCI
.

Thus
,
such
early
protective
effects
may
even
lead
to
functional
recovery
in
long

injury

Whole
chromosome
aneuploidy
in
the
brain
of
Bub1bH
/
H
and
Ercc1-
/
Δ7
mice
.

High
levels
of
aneuploidy
have
been
observed
in
disease-free
tissues
,
including
post-mitotic
tissues
such
as
the
brain
.

Using
a
quantitative
interphase-fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
approach
,
we
previously
reported
a
chromosome-specific
,
age
-related
increase
in
aneuploidy
in
the
mouse
cerebral
cortex
.

Increased
aneuploidy
has
been
associated
with
defects
in
DNA
repair
and
the
spindle
assembly
checkpoint
,
which
in
turn
can
lead
to
premature
aging
.

Here
,
we
quantified
the
frequency
of
aneuploidy
of
three
autosomes
in
the
cerebral
cortex
and
cerebellum
of
adult
and
developing
brain
of
Bub1b
(
H
/
H
)
mice
,
which
have
a
faulty
mitotic
checkpoint
,
and
Ercc1
(
-
/
Δ7
)
mice
,
defective
in
nucleotide
excision
repair
and
inter-strand
cross-link
repair
.

Surprisingly
,
the
level
of
aneuploidy
in
the
brain
of
these
murine
models
of
accelerated
aging
remains
as
low
as
in
the
young
adult
brains
from
control
animals
,
i.e.
<
1
%
in
the
cerebral
cortex
and
∼0.1
%
in
the
cerebellum
.

Therefore
,
based
on
aneuploidy
,
these
adult
mice
with
reduced
life
span
and
accelerated
progeroid
features
are
indistinguishable
from
age
-matched
,
normal
controls
.

Yet
,
during
embryonic
development
,
we
found
that
Bub1b
(
H
/
H
)
,
but
not
Ercc1
(
-
/
Δ7
)
mice
,
have
a
significantly
higher
frequency
of
aneuploid
nuclei
relative
to
wild-type
controls
in
the
cerebral
cortex
,
reaching
a
frequency
as
high
as
40.3
%
for
each
chromosome
tested
.

Aneuploid
cells
in
these
mutant
mice
are
likely
eliminated
early
in
development
through
apoptosis
and
/
or
immune
-mediated
clearance
mechanisms
,
which
would
explain
the
low
levels
of
aneuploidy
during
adulthood
in
the
cerebral
cortex
of
Bub1b
(
H
/
H
)
mice
.

These
results
shed
light
on
the
mechanisms
of
removal
of
aneuploidy
cells
in
vivo

Effects
of

tenacissima
polysaccharide
on
the
immune
regulation
and

growth
in
H22

.

One
water-soluble
polysaccharide
(
Marsdenia
tenacissima
polysaccharide
,
MTP
)
,
with
an
average
molecular
weight
of
4.9
×
10
(
4
)
Da
,
was
isolated
from
the
dried
rattan
of
M.
tenacissima
.

MTP
contained
93.8
%
carbohydrates
,
5.6
%
proteins
and
21.3
%
uronic
acid
,
and
were
composed
of
arabinose
,
mannose
,
galactose
,
xylose
,
glucuronic
acid
at
a
molar
ratio
of
9.1
,
17.7
,
30.2
,
22.4
and
20.6
.

The
experiments
on
the
animals
showed
that
MTP
could
increase
the
serum
hemolysin
,
promote
the
formation
of
antibody
-forming
cells
and
improve
the
phagocytosis
of
mononuclear
macrophage
in
normal
mice
.

Meanwhile
,
MTP
could
also
inhibit
the
growth
of
tumor
in
H22
tumor
-bearing
mice
dose
-dependently
,
and
increase
the
spleen
index
,
thymus
index
and
serum
albumin
level
in
the
mice
.

In
addition
,
MTP
could
elevate
the
serum
level
of
TNF-α
and
IL-2
,
increase
the
activity
of
GSH-Px
,
CAT
and
SOD
in
the
liver
tissue
,
and
reduce
the
content
of
VEGF
and
MDA
.

These
results
suggest
that
MTP
can
regulate
the
immune
function
in
mice
and
suppress
the
growth
of
tumor
in
H22
tumor
-bearing
mice
,
and
its
antitumor
activity
may
be
related
to
its
antioxidant
and
immunomodulatory
effects

RATIONALE
:
Cystic
fibrosis
(
CF
)
is
a
common
genetic
disease
caused
by
mutations
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
transmembrane
conductance
regulator
(
CFTR
)
gene
.

Persistent
lung
inflammation
,
characterized
by
increasing
polymorphonuclear
leukocyte
recruitment
,
is
a
major
cause
of
the
decline
in
respiratory
function
in
patients
with
CF
and
is
a
leading
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
.

CFTR
is
expressed
in
various
cell
types
,
including
leukocytes
,
but
its
involvement
in
the
regulation
of
leukocyte
recruitment
is
unknown
.

OBJECTIVES
:
We
evaluated
whether
CF
leukocytes
might
present
with
alterations
in
cell
adhesion
and
migration
,
a
key
process
governing
innate
and
acquired
immune
responses
.

METHODS
:
We
used
ex
vivo
adhesion
and
chemotaxis
assays
,
flow
cytometry
,
immunofluorescence
,
and
GTPase
activity
assays
in
this
study
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
We
found
that
chemoattractant
-induced
activation
of
β1
and
β2
integrins
and
of
chemotaxis
is
defective
in
mononuclear
cells
isolated
from
patients
with
CF
.

In
contrast
,
polymorphonuclear
leukocyte
adhesion
and
chemotaxis
were
normal
.

The
functionality
of
β1
and
β2
integrins
was
restored
by
treatment
of
CF
monocytes
with
the
CFTR
-correcting
drugs
VRT325
and
VX809
.

Moreover
,
treatment
of
healthy
monocytes
with
the
CFTR
inhibitor
CFTR
(
inh
)
-172
blocked
integrin
activation
by
chemoattractants
.

In
a
murine
model
of
lung
inflammation
,
we
found
that
integrin
-independent
migration
of
CF
monocytes
into
the
lung
parenchyma
was
normal
,
whereas
,
in
contrast
,
integrin
-dependent
transmigration
into
the
alveolar
space
was
impaired
.

Finally
,
signal
transduction
analysis
showed
that
,
in
CF
monocytes
,
chemoattractant
-triggered
activation
of
RhoA
and
CDC42
Rho
small
GTPases
(
controlling
integrin
activation
and
chemotaxis
,
respectively
)
was
strongly
deficient
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Altogether
,
these
data
highlight
the
critical
regulatory
role
of
CFTR
in
integrin
activation
by
chemoattractants
in
monocytes
and
identify
CF
as
a
new
,
cell
type
-selective
leukocyte
adhesion
deficiency
disease
,
providing
new
insights
into

The

A
exhibits
activity
in

and
in

in
prostate
cancer
.

Despite
recent
advances
in
the
treatment
of
metastatic
castration
-resistant
prostate
cancer
(
CRPC
)
,
outcome
of
patients
remains
poor
due
to
the
development
of
drug
resistance
.

Thus
,
new
drugs
are
urgently
needed
.

We
investigated
efficacy
,
toxicity
and
mechanism
of
action
of
marine
triterpene
glycoside
frondoside
A
(
FrA
)
using
CRPC
cell
lines
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

FrA
revealed
high
efficacy
in
human
prostate
cancer
cells
,
while
non
-malignant
cells
were
less
sensitive
.

Remarkably
,
proliferation
and
colony
formation
of
cells
resistant
to
enzalutamide
and
abiraterone
(
due
to
the
androgen
receptor
splice
variant
AR-V7
)
were
also
significantly
inhibited
by
FrA
.

The
marine
compound
caused
cell
type
specific
cell
cycle
arrest
and
induction
of
caspase
-dependent
or
-independent
apoptosis
.

Up-regulation
or
induction
of
several
pro-apoptotic
proteins
(
Bax
,
Bad
,
PTEN
)
,
cleavage
of
PARP
and
caspase-3
and
down-regulation
of
anti-apoptotic
proteins
(
survivin
and
Bcl-2
)
were
detected
in
treated
cells
.

Global
proteome
analysis
revealed
regulation
of
proteins
involved
in
formation
of
metastases
,
tumor
cell
invasion
,
and
apoptosis
,
like
keratin
81
,
CrkII
,
IL-1β
and
cathepsin
B
.

Inhibition
of
pro-survival
autophagy
was
observed
following
FrA
exposure
.

In
vivo
,
FrA
inhibited
tumor
growth
of
PC-3
and
DU145
cells
with
a
notable
reduction
of
lung
metastasis
,
as
well
as
circulating
tumor
cells
in
the
peripheral
blood
.

Increased
lymphocyte
counts
of
treated
animals
might
indicate
an
immune
modulating
effect
of
FrA
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
suggest
that
FrA
is
a
promising
new
drug
for
the
treatment
of
mCRPC
.

Induction
of
apoptosis
,
inhibition
of
pro-survival
autophagy
,
and
immune
modulatory
effects
are
suspected
modes
of
actions

Spatiotemporally

-controlled
intratumoral
depot
for
combination
of
brachytherapy
and
photodynamic
therapy
for
solid
tumor
.

In
an
attempt
to
spatiotemporally
control
both
tumor
retention
and
the
coverage
of
anticancer
agents
,
we
developed
a
photoradiation
-controlled
intratumoral
depot
(
PRCITD
)
driven
by
convection
enhanced
delivery
(
CED
)
.

This
intratumoral
depot
consists
of
recombinant
elastin
-like
polypeptide
(
ELP
)
containing
periodic
cysteine
residues
and
is
conjugated
with
a
photosensitizer
,
chlorin-e6
(
Ce6
)
at
the
N-terminus
of
the
ELP
.

We
hypothesized
that
this
cysteine
-containing
ELP
(
cELP
)
can
be
readily
crosslinked
through
disulfide
bonds
upon
exposure
to
oxidative
agents
,
specifically
the
singlet
oxygen
produced
during
photodynamic
stimulation
.

Upon
intratumoral
injection
,
CED
drives
the
distribution
of
the
soluble
polypeptide
freely
throughout
the
tumor
interstitium
.

Formation
and
retention
of
the
depot
was
monitored
using
fluorescence
molecular
tomography
imaging
.

When
imaging
shows
that
the
polypeptide
has
distributed
throughout
the
entire
tumor
,
660-nm
light
is
applied
externally
at
the
tumor
site
.

This
photo-radiation
wavelength
excites
Ce6
and
generates
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
in
the
presence
of
oxygen
.

The
ROS
induce
in
situ
disulfide
crosslinking
of
the
cysteine
thiols
,
stabilizing
the
ELP
biopolymer
into
a
stable
therapeutic
depot
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
this
ELP
design
effectively
forms
a
hydrogel
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

These
depots
exhibit
high
stability
in
subcutaneous
tumor
xenografts
in
nude
mice
and
significantly
improved
intratumoral
retention
compared
to
controls
without
crosslinking
,
as
seen
by
fluorescent
imaging
and
iodine-125
radiotracer
studies
.

The
photodynamic
therapy
provided
by
the
PRCITD
was
found
to
cause
significant
tumor
inhibition
in
a
Ce6
dose
dependent
manner
.

Additionally
,
the
combination
of
PDT
and
intratumoral
radionuclide
therapy
co
-delivered
by
PRCITD
provided
a
greater
antitumor
effect
than
either
monotherapy
alone
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
PRCITD
could
provide
a
stable
platform
for
delivering
synergistic
,
anti-cancer
drug
depots

In
recent
years
extensive
numbers
of
molecular
diagnostic
methods
have
been
developed
to
meet
the
need
of
point-of-care
devices
.

Efforts
have
been
made
towards
producing
rapid
,
simple
and
inexpensive
DNA
tests
,
especially
in
the
diagnostics
field
.

We
report
on
the
development
of
a
label
-based
lateral
flow
dipstick
for
the
rapid
and
simple
detection
of
multiplex
loop

(
m-LAMP
)
amplicons
.

A
label
-based
m-LAMP
lateral
flow
dipstick
assay
was
developed
for
the
simultaneous
detection
of
target
DNA
template
and
a
LAMP
internal
control
.

This
biosensor
operates
through
a
label
based
system
,
in
which
probe-hybridization
and
the
additional
incubation
step
are
eliminated
.

We
demonstrated
this
m-LAMP
assay
by
detecting
pathogenic
Leptospira
,
which
causes
the
re
-emerging
disease
Leptospirosis
.

The
lateral
flow
dipstick
was
developed
to
detect
of
three
targets
,
the
LAMP
target
amplicon
,
the
LAMP
internal
control
amplicon
and
a
chromatography
control
.

Three
lines
appeared
on
the
dipstick
,
indicating
positive
results
for
all
representative
pathogenic
Leptospira
species
,
whereas
two
lines
appeared
,
indicating
negative
results
,
for
other
bacterial
species

.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
long-term
safety
of
surgically
administered
recombinant
adeno
-associated
virus
serotype-2
(
rAAV2
)
-neurturin
(
NRTN
)
to
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Publications
from
prior
trials
reported
no
unexpected
or
troubling
adverse
events
related
to
the
vector
or
transgene
comprising
rAAV2-NRTN
.

Because
rAAV2-NRTN
produces
long-term
NRTN
expression
,
subjects
were
enrolled
in
a
long-term
safety
assessment
protocol
of
rAAV2-NRTN
.

This
article
presents
safety
data
for
up
to
5
years
,
well
beyond
that
reported
in
the
initial
publications
.

Data
from
53
patients
are
included
;
47
received
rAAV2-NRTN
bilaterally
to
the
putamen
,
whereas
6
subjects
received
rAAV2-NRTN
bilaterally
into
putamen-plus
-substantia
nigra
.

Patients
underwent
in-person
safety
assessments
on
a
quarterly
to
bi-annual
basis
,
including
adverse
event
monitoring
,
physical
and
neurological
examinations
,
brain
MRI
,
and
laboratory
testing
.

Parkinsonian
status
was
assessed
in
an
unblinded
fashion
.

Fifty-three
subjects
completed
the
long-term
safety
protocol
.

Nine
nonserious
adverse
events
(
non-SAEs
)
in
6
subjects
were
deemed
"
possibly
related
"
to
rAAV2-NRTN
by
the
principal
investigator
,
whereas
none
were
deemed
"
related
"
to
rAAV2-NRTN
.

Over
the
course
of
long-term
observation
,
33
SAEs
were
reported
in
18
subjects
,
all
of
who
received
rAAV2-NRTN
into
putamen-only
;
31
SAEs
were
deemed
not
related
to
rAAV2-NRTN
,
and
2
were
deemed
unlikely
related
.

Safety
assessments
showed
no
clinically
relevant
changes
in
examination
,
imaging
,
or
laboratory
studies
.

Motor
status
,
on
average
,
was
stable
or
apparently
modestly
improved
(
relative
to
baseline
)
over
the
course
of
the
open-label
,
long-term
follow-up
.

These
findings
provide
evidence
for
the
long-term
safety
of
neurturin
when
delivered
to
the
putamen
or
the
putamen-plus
-substantia
nigra
via
stereotactic
surgery
and
rAAV2
gene
transfer
.

They
therefore
supplement
the
safety
results
reported
in
four
prior
publications
from
the
same
subjects
,
significantly
extending
the
safety
data
for
gene
therapy
and
neurotrophic
factor
expression
targeting
the
brain
and
adding
to
growing
evidence
that
rAAV
vector
-mediated
gene
therapy
to
the
CNS
can
be
administered
safely

Functional
Behavior
of
NKp46
-Positive
Intrahepatic
Natural
Killer
Cells
Against
Hepatitis
C
Virus
Reinfection
After
Liver
Transplantation
.

BACKGROUND
:
NKp46
expression
in
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cells
has
recently
been
shown
to
affect
the
responsiveness
to
antiviral
treatment
in
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
-infected
patients
.

However
,
the
density
of
NKp46
on
intrahepatic
NK
cells
is
remarkably
higher
than
that
on
peripherally
circulating
NK
cells
,
whereas
the
biophylactic
function
of
intrahepatic
NK
cells
against
HCV
reinfection
remains
unclear
.

METHODS
:
We
analyzed
the
phenotypic
and
functional
properties
of
intrahepatic
NK
cells
using
mononuclear
cells
extracted
from
ex
vivo
liver
perfusates
from
living
liver
transplantation
donors
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
intrahepatic
NK
cells
in
relation
to
HCV
infection
,
we
evaluated
posttransplant
HCV
load
kinetics
in
HCV
-related
patients
.

RESULTS
:
Intrahepatic
NK
cells
from
healthy
donors
showed
a
distinctive
phenotype
even
in
each
of
the
CD56
and
CD56
fractions
compared
with
peripheral
blood
NK
cells
.

In
the
assays
using
a
Huh7-HCV
replicon
system
,
anti-HCV
activity
was
induced
via
recognition
of
the
NK
cell
receptors
,
including
NKp46
,
NKp30
,
and
NKG2D
,
which
was
demonstrated
by
the
use
of
monoclonal
antibodies
that
neutralized
neutralizing
molecules
.

Unexpectedly
,
the
density
of
NKp46
on
intrahepatic
NK
cells
varied
considerably
among
individuals
,
allowing
us
to
demonstrate
that
HCV
reload
in
the
early
posttransplant
period
was
delayed
in
recipients
of
liver
allografts
containing
a
higher
proportion
of
NKp46
NK
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Intrahepatic
NKp46
NK
cells
exhibited
anti-HCV
activity
via
cell-to-cell
contact
.

The
variation
of
the
NKp46
proportion
in
individuals
could
be
attributed
to
the
diversity
of
HCV
resistance
observed
in
these
individuals
,
which
possibly
reflects
the
clinical
outcome
of
infection
in
patients
.

Suppression

interactions
by
MCS-18
--
Impact
on
advanced
atherosclerosis
in
ApoE
-deficient
mice
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Atherosclerosis
is
associated
with
chronic
inflammatory
responses
of
the
arterial
blood
vessels
.

The
previously
observed
protective
effect
of
the
MCS-18
substance
against
the
initiation
of
atherosclerosis
in
a
murine
model
was
explained
by
its
pronounced
anti-inflammatory
activity
.

Here
,
we
investigated
its
impact
on
murine
plaque
progression
in
advanced
atherosclerosis
and
on
proatherogenic
processes
.

APPROACH
&
RESULTS
:
ApoE
-deficient
mice
were
fed
a
high-fat
diet
for
12
weeks
to
induce
atherosclerosis
,
followed
by
normal
chow
and
intraperitoneal
injections
of
either
MCS-18
(
500
μg
,
n
=
10
)
or
saline
(
n
=
10
)
twice
a
week
for
another
12
weeks
.

Plaque
size
was
reduced
in
MCS-18
treated
mice
compared
to
controls
(
p
=
0.001
)
,
which
was
associated
with
a
reduced
size
of
the
lipid
core
(
p
=
0.01
)
.

There
was
a
decrease
in
apoptotic
cells
(
p
=
0.02
)
,
endothelial
ICAM-1
expression
(
p
<
0.001
)
,
and
macrophage
density
(
p
=
0.01
)
in
the
MCS-18
group
.

In
addition
,
human
and
murine
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
and
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
were
treated
with
MCS-18
(
50-200
μg
/
ml
)
to
analyze
cell
migration
and
adhesion
under
flow
conditions
.

MCS-18
reduced
human
(
p
=
0.01
)
and
murine
(
p
=
0.006
)
DC
migration
.

Furthermore
,
adhesion
of
MCS-18
-treated
DCs
to
a
HUVEC
monolayer
was
decreased
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

Compared
to
controls
,
CD209
(
p
<
0.001
)
and
CCR7
(
p
=
0.003
)
expression
was
decreased
in
MCS-18
-treated
DCs
,
while
in
HUVECs
lower
levels
of
ICAM-1
(
p
<
0.001
)
and
of
phosphorylated
NF-κB-p65
(
p
=
0.002
)
were
observed
.

Blocking
of
ICAM-1
reduced
DC
adhesion
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
MCS-18
exhibits
interesting
therapeutic
effects
when
applied
in
advanced
murine
atherosclerosis
.

Its
antiatherogenic
impact
might
be
associated
with
a
suppressed
adhesion
to
the
endothelium
due
to
down-regulation
of
endothelial
ICAM-1
expression
.

Cirrhosis
impairs
immune
functions
and
increases
susceptibility
to
bacterial
infection
.

We
recently
showed
that
neutrophils
from
patients
with
decompensated
alcoholic
cirrhosis
exhibit
a
severe
impairment
of
formylpeptide
receptor
(
fPR
)
-mediated
intracellular
signaling
and
superoxide
production
.

Here
,
we
performed
ex
vivo
studies
with
these
patients'neutrophils
to
further
investigate
myeloperoxidase
release
,
bactericidal
capacity
and
signaling
events
following
fPR
stimulation
by
the
formylpeptide
formyl-met-leu-phe
(
fMLP
)
.

METHODS
:
Myeloperoxidase
release
was
studied
by
measuring
extracellular
myeloperoxidase
activity
.

Activation
of
signaling
effectors
was
studied
by
Western
blot
and
their
respective
contribution
to
myeloperoxidase
release
studied
using
pharmacological
antagonists
.

RESULTS
:
fMLP
-induced
myeloperoxidase
release
was
strongly
impaired
in
patients'neutrophils
whereas
the
intracellular
myeloperoxidase
stock
was
unaltered
.

The
fMLP
-induced
phosphorylation
of
major
signaling
effectors
,
AKT
,
ERK1
/
2
and
p38-MAP-Kinases
,
was
also
strongly
deficient
despite
a
similar
expression
of
signaling
effectors
or
fPR
.

However
,
based
on
effector
inhibition
in
healthy
neutrophils
,
AKT
and
p38-MAPK
but
not
ERK1
/
2
upregulated
fMLP
-induced
myeloperoxidase
exocytosis
.

Interestingly
,
patients'neutrophils
exhibited
a
defective
bactericidal
capacity
that
was
reversed
ex
vivo
by
the
TLR7
/
8
agonist
CL097
,
through
potentiation
of
the
fMLP
-induced
AKT
/
p38-MAPK
signaling
axis
and
myeloperoxidase
release
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
provide
first
evidence
that
neutrophils
from
patients
with
decompensated
alcoholic
cirrhosis
exhibit
a
deficient
AKT
/
p38-MAPK
signaling
,
myeloperoxidase
release
and
bactericidal
activity
,
which
can
be
reversed
via
TLR7
/
8
activation
.

These
defects
,
together
with
the
previously
described
severe
deficient
superoxide
production
,
may
increase
cirrhotic
patients'susceptibility
to

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
In
advanced
cirrhosis
,
gut
bacterial
translocation
is
the
consequence
of
intestinal
barrier
disruption
and
leads
to
bacterial
infection
.

Bile
acid
abnormalities
in
cirrhosis
could
play
a
role
in
the
integrity
of
the
intestinal
barrier
and
the
control
of
microbiota
,
mainly
through
the
farnesoid
X
receptor
.

We
investigated
the
long-term
effects
of
the
farnesoid
X

,
obeticholic

,
on

.

METHODS
:
Cirrhotic
rats
received
a
2-week
course
of
obeticholic
acid
or
vehicle
starting
once
ascites

.

We
then
determined

.

RESULTS
:
Obeticholic

reduced
bacterial
translocation
from
78.3
%
to
33.3
%
(

and
upregulated
the

.

Treatment
improved

.

Enteric
bacterial

normalized
,
and
the
distinctive

was
reduced
.

Gut

was
reduced
and

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
ascitic

rats
,
obeticholic
acid
reduces
gut
bacterial
translocation
via
several
complementary
mechanisms

A
total
of
24

The

RATIONALE
:
Abnormal

are
found
in

.

There
is
no
specific
treatment
strategy
to
compensate
for
these
innate
immune
abnormalities
.

Recent
findings
suggest
AMs
are
of
early
embryonic
or
fetal
origin
.

Pluripotent

as
a
source
of
embryonic

AMs
for
therapeutic
use
in
acute

OBJECTIVES
:
To
determine
if
embryonic
Myb
(

alveolar
-like
macrophages
have
therapeutic
value
on
pulmonary
transplantation
in
acute
and
chronic
airway
diseases
.

METHODS
:
Directed
differentiation
of
murine
PSCs
was
used
in
factor
-defined
media
to
produce
expandable
embryonic
macrophages
conditioned
to
an
alveolar
-like
phenotype
with
granulocyte-macrophage
colony
-stimulating
factor
.

AMs
were
partially
depleted
in
mice
to
create
an
acute
lung

.

To
model
a
chronic

disease
,
ADA
(

)
mice
were
used
.

Alveolar
-like
macrophages
were
intratracheally
transplanted
to
the
injured
animals
and
therapeutic
potential
was
determined
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
The
differentiation
protocol
is
highly
efficient
and
adaptable
to
human
PSCs
.

The
PSC
macrophages
are
phenotypically
like
AMs
both
functionally
and
by
ligand
marker
characterization
.

They
engulf
bacteria
and
apoptotic
cells
and
are
better
phagocytes
than
bone
marrow
-derived
macrophages
.

In
vivo
,
these
macrophages
remain
in
healthy
airways
for
at
least
4
weeks
,
can
engulf
neutrophils
during
acute
lung
injury
,
enhance
pulmonary
tissue
repair
,
and
promote
survival
in
ADA
(

)
mice
.

Animals
receiving
the
macrophages
do
not
develop
abnormal
pathology
or
teratomas
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
PSCs
are
a
reliable
source
to
produce
therapeutically
active
alveolar
-like
macrophages
to
treat
airway

,
underlying
the
universality
of
the

associated
with

.

Accordingly
,
htrA

was
implemented
for
the
development
of
a

.

The

In
spite
of
this
attenuation

Avian

emerged
in
February
2013

Liver

is
present
in
29
%
of
patients
with
A
(

)
infection
,
some
of
whom
experience
severe
liver
injury
.

Hypoxic
hepatitis
(
HH
)
is
a
type
of
acute
severe
liver
injury
characterized
by
an
abrupt
,
massive
increase
in
serum
aminotransferases
resulting
from
anoxic
centrilobular
necrosis
of
liver
cells
.

In
the

,
the
prevalence
of
HH

Here
,

incidence
of
HH
in
the
largest
single

cohort
of
ICU
patients
with
A
(
H7N9
)
infection
.

Both
HH
patients
presented
with
multiple
organ
failure
(
MOF
)
involving
respiratory
,
cardiac
,
circulatory
and
renal
failure
and
had
a
history
of
chronic
heart
disease
.

On
admission
,
severe
liver
impairment
was
found
.

Peak
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
and
aspartate

were
937
and

and
3117
and
3029
U
/
L
,
respectively
,
in
the
two
patients
.

Unfortunately
,
both
patients
died
due
to
deterioration
of
MOF
.

A
post-mortem
biopsy
in
case

confirmed
the
presence
of
centrilobular

was
negative
,
which
excluded

)
-related
hepatitis
.

The
incidence
of
HH
in
A
(
H7N9
)
patients
is
similar
to
that
in
ICU
patients
with
other
aetiologies
.

It
seems
that
patients
with
A
(
H7N9
)
infection
and
a
history
of
chronic
heart
disease
with
a
low
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
on
admission
are
susceptible
to
HH
,
which
presents
as
a
marked
elevation
in
ALT
at
the

IL-17A

Virus

.

B-1
cells
play
a
critical
role
in
early
protection
during
influenza
infections
by
producing
natural
IgM
antibodies
.

However
,
the
underlying
mechanisms
involved
in
regulating
this
process
are
largely
unknown
.

Here
we
found
that
during
influenza
infection
pleural
cavity
B-1a
cells
rapidly
infiltrated
lungs
,
where
they
underwent
plasmacytic
differentiation
with
enhanced
IgM
production
.

This
process
was
promoted
by
IL-17A
signaling
via
induction
of
Blimp-1
expression
and
NF-κB
activation
in
B-1a
cells
.

Deficiency
of
IL-17A
led
to
severely
impaired
B-1a
-derived
antibody
production
in
the
respiratory
tract
,
resulting
in
a
deficiency

Together
,
we
identify
a
critical
function
of
IL-17A
in
promoting
the
plasmacytic
differentiation
of
B-1a

.

Our

Novel
method
to
improve
vascularization
of
tissue
engineered
constructs
with
biodegradable
fibers
.

Tissue
engineered
grafts
lack
adequate
vascularization
and
suffer
from
poor
perfusion
in
vivo
curtailing
clinical
application
.

Improving
vascularization
in
any
tissue
implants
would
hence
increase
their
survivability
and
treatment
efficacy
.

Many
prevascularization
strategies
established
to
date
involves
the
angiogenic
induction
of
endothelial
progenitor
cells
in
thick
tissue
engineered
scaffolds
to
obtain
vascularization
.

These
3D
scaffolds
typically
require
a
dynamic
cell
culturing
system
involving
/
needful
of
bioreactors
to
obtain
vascularization
in
thick
tissue
engineered
scaffolds
.

Herein
,
we
developed
a
novel
method
to
engineer
a
vessel
network
without
bioreactor
,
where
3D
blood
vessels
could
be
simply
obtained
in
a
2D
static
cell
culturing
system
.

This
network
could
be
used
to
augment
the
prevascularization
of
tissue
engineered
grafts
.

Endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
were
confluently
cultured
on
resorbable
electrospun
poly
(
D
,
L-lactide-co-glycolide
)
microfibers
of
capillary
dimensions
.

These
cell
encapsulated
capillary
fibers
were
further
embedded
in
collagen
with
HUVECs
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
.

Green
fluorescent
protein
and
red
fluorescent
protein
expressing
HUVECs
were
used
to
label
cells
on
fiber
and
in
collagen
respectively
for
visualization
and
monitoring
of
capillary
network
formation
.

Seeded
HUVECs
in
the
hybrid
construct
were
subsequently
cultured
for
30
days
before
implantation
.

Vessel
density
was
measured
by
the
total
tubule
length
per
unit
area
at
different
time
points
.

In
vitro
results
indicated
that
the
fibers
provide
contact
guidance
to
form
primary
networks
to
direct
more
vessels
branching
of
HUVECs
in
hybrid
constructs
and
the
vessel
integrity
of
microvasculature
was
retained
after
fiber
degradation
.

In
addition
,
these
preformed
engineered
capillaries
could
capably
inosculate
with
de
novo
capillaries
in
collagen
when
combined
,
giving
rise
to
a
hybrid
pre
-vascularized
scaffold
of
more
extensive
vessel
network
and
interconnections
,
thereby
markedly
improved
prevascularization
.

When
implanted
onto
the
dorsal
skin
of
immune
-deficient
mice
,
vessels
of
hybrid
pre
-vascularized
scaffold
also
rapidly
anastomosed
with
mice
vasculature
within
a
day
as
confirmed
with
the
immunostaining
of
endothelial
cell
markers
CD31
and
von
Willebrand
factor
.

This
proof
of
concept
study
showed
that
artificial
capillaries
formed
through
contact
guidance
of
endothelial
cells
on
resorbable
capillary
sized
microfibers
can
significantly
enhance
prevascularization
in
tissue
engineered
constructs
intended
for
surgical
implantation

In

the
MDSC

was
evaluated

,
where
cell

are
involved
in

Our
data
demonstrated
that
both
the
numbers

suppressive
functions
of
MDSCs
were
impaired
in
the
peripheral
blood

And

promoted
the
suppressive

.

Moreover
,
the
expression
of
interleukin

was
significantly
upregulated
in

Elevated

was
identified
in

.

Transfection

efficiently
blocked

and
not
well
captured
by
standard
genome-wide

study
approaches
.

Here
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
variations
in
KIR
gene
content
combined
with

there
was
a

the

KIR2DS3
for

Furthermore
,
there
was
significant
interaction
between

(
containing
the

.

Similar

greatly
attenuated
associations
were
observed
for

Moreover
,
previous
in

models
demonstrated
that
p53
is
required
for
upregulation
of

,
and
accordingly
,
we
observed
there
was
a
strong
association
between
the
KIR
B
haplotype
and
p53
alteration

higher
likelihood
that

harbor
abnormal

Taken
together
,
our
data
suggest
that
functional
interactions
between
KIR
and
HLA
modify
risks
of
BCC

that
KIR

provides
selective
pressure
for

Cell

Significant

The
effect
induced
by

be
blocked
by
pre-incubation
of
the
antibody
with
the

and
antibody
generation

indicating
that
the
effect
of
the

.

In
mice
inoculated
with
HNSCC

i.v.
injections
of
the

resulted
within
70
days

destruction
in

In

considerably
delayed

These
results
demonstrate
that
the
LOXL4-mAb
has
potent
antitumor
activity

suggest
its
suitability

Effect
of
Aging
on
Periodontal
Inflammation
,
Microbial
Colonization
,
and
Disease
Susceptibility
.

Periodontitis
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
disease
induced
by
a
biofilm
that
forms
on
the
tooth
surface
.

Increased
periodontal
disease
is
associated
with
aging
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
aging
on
challenge
by
oral
pathogens
,
examining
the
host
response
,
colonization
,
and
osteoclast
numbers
in
aged
versus
young
mice
.

We
also
compared
the
results
with
mice
with
lineage-specific
deletion
of
the
transcription
factor
FOXO1
,
which
reduces
dendritic
cell
(
DC
)
function
.

Periodontitis
was
induced
by
oral
inoculation
of
Porphyromonas
gingivalis
and
Fusobacterium
nucleatum
in
young
(
4
to
5
mo
)
and
aged
(
14
to
15
mo
)
mice
.

Aged
mice
as
well
as
mice
with
reduced
DC
function
had
decreased
numbers
of
DCs
in
lymph
nodes
,
indicative
of
a
diminished
host
response
.

In
vitro
studies
suggest
that
reduced
DC
numbers
in
lymph
nodes
of
aged
mice
may
involve
the
effect
of
advanced
glycation
end
products
on
DC
migration
.

Surprisingly
,
aged
mice
but
not
mice
with
genetically
altered
DC
function
had
greater
production
of
antibody
to
P.
gingivalis
,
greater
IL-12
expression
,
and
more
plasma
cells
in
lymph
nodes
following
oral
inoculation
as
compared
with
young
mice
.

The
greater
adaptive
immune
response
in
aged
versus
young
mice
was
linked
to
enhanced
levels
of
P.
gingivalis
and
reduced
bacterial
diversity
.

Thus
,
reduced
bacterial
diversity
in
aged
mice
may
contribute
to
increased
P.
gingivalis
colonization
following
inoculation
and
increased
periodontal
disease
susceptibility
,
reflected
by
higher
TNF
levels
and
osteoclast
numbers
in
the
periodontium
of
aged
versus
young
mice

This
was
accompanied
by
an
increased

We
show
for
the
first
time
that
increased
Sn
expression
on
microglia

contributes
to
neural
perturbation
in
two
distinct

indicate
that
a
rarely
described
CD8

T-cell
population
can
regulate
the
corresponding
diseases
.

These

ILC3
GM-CSF
production

orchestrate
acute
intestinal
inflammation
.

Innate
lymphoid
cells
(
ILCs
)
contribute
to
host
defence
and
tissue
repair
but
can
induce
immunopathology
.

Recent
work
has
revealed
tissue-specific
roles
for
ILCs
;
however
,
the
question
of
how
a
small
population
has
large
effects
on
immune
homeostasis
remains
unclear
.

We
identify
two
mechanisms
that
ILC3s
utilise
to
exert
their
effects
within
intestinal
tissue
.

ILC-driven
colitis
depends
on
production
of
granulocyte
macrophage-colony
stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
,
which
recruits
and
maintains
intestinal
inflammatory
monocytes
.

ILCs
present
in
the
intestine
also
enter
and
exit
cryptopatches
in
a
highly
dynamic
process
.

During
colitis
,
ILC3s
mobilize
from
cryptopatches
,
a
process
that
can
be
inhibited
by
blocking
GM-CSF
,
and
mobilization
precedes
inflammatory
foci
elsewhere
in
the
tissue
.

Together
these
data
identify
the
IL-23R
/
GM-CSF
axis
within
ILC3
as
a
key
control
point
in
the
accumulation
of
innate
effector
cells
in
the
intestine
and
in
the
spatio-temporal
dynamics
of
ILCs
in
the
intestinal
inflammatory

Factors
Affecting
Anti-Glycan

.

Serum
anti-glycan
antibodies
play
important
roles
in
many
immune
processes
and
are
of
particular
interest
as
biomarkers
for
many
diseases
.

Changes
in
anti-glycan
antibodies
can
occur
with
the
onset
of
disease
or
in
response
to
stimuli
such
as
pathogens
and
vaccination
.

Understanding
relationships
between
anti-glycan
antibody
repertoires
and
genetic
and
environment
factors
is
critical
for
basic
research
and
clinical
applications
,
but
little
information
is
available
.

In
this

we
evaluated
the
effects
of
age
,
race
,
gender
,
and
blood
type
on
anti-glycan
antibody
profiles
in
the
serum
of
135
healthy
subjects
.

As
expected
,
IgG
and
IgM
antibody
signals
to
blood
group
antigens
correlated
strongly
with
blood
type
.

Interestingly
,
antibodies
to
other
non-ABH
glycans
,
such
as
the
alpha-Gal
antigen
,
also
correlated
with
blood
type
.

A
statistically
significant
decline
in
IgM
signals
with
age
was
observed
for
many
antibody
subpopulations
,
but
not
for
IgG
.

Moreover
,
statistically
significant
correlations
between
race
and
IgG
levels
to
certain
LacNAc
-containing
glycans
were
observed
.

The
results
have
important
implications
for
designing
studies
and
interpreting
results
in
the
area
of
biomarker
discovery
and
for
the
development
of

The
study
also
highlights
the
importance
of
collecting
and
reporting
patient
information
that
could

PTD
-fused
p53
as
a
potential
antiviral
agent
directly
suppresses
HBV
transcription
and
expression
.

In
Hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
infection
,
the
virus
generates
numerous
viral
mRNAs
/
proteins
and
viral
loads
,
which
plays
a
major
role
in
driving
T
cell
tolerance
,
viral
persistence
,
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
.

However
,
currently
available
anti-HBV
agents
have
no
direct
effect
on
viral
mRNA
transcription
and
protein
expression
.

In
this
study
,
we
designed
a
recombinant
fusion
of
p53
protein
with
the
cell
-penetrating
peptide
PTD
(
protein
transduction
domain
of
trans-activator
of
transcription
)
,
which
mediated
p53
internalization
into
hepatocytes
.

PTD-p53
effectively
suppressed
HBV
transcription
and
antigen
expression
by
interaction
with
viral
enhancers
.

We
further
provide
evidence
that
PTD-p53
counteracts
the
viral
transcription
feedback
loop
and
effectively
suppressed
HBV
production
of

well
as
HBsAg
,
HBeAg
,
and
HBcAg
,
both
in

Our
results
thereby
provide
a

for
developing
a
new
therapeutic
approach

we
assess
the
impact
of
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms

in
a
cluster
of
three
genes
that
affect
inflammation
and
neuronal

:
P2X7R
,
P2X4R

HIV-SN

the
Brief

tool
,
with

defined
by
bilateral
symptoms
and

.

Forty-five
SNPs
in
P2X7R
,
P2X4R
and

were
genotyped
using
TaqMan

DNA
samples
from

Haplotypes
were

using
the

SNP

Overall
,
CAMKK2
exhibited
the

Relative
Resistance
of
HLA-B
to
Downregulation
by
Naturally
Occurring
HIV-1
Nef
Sequences
.

UNLABELLED
:
HIV-1
Nef
binds
to
the
cytoplasmic
region
of
HLA-A
and
HLA-B
and
downregulates
these
molecules
from
the
surface
of
virus
-infected
cells
,
thus
evading
immune
detection
by
CD8
(
+
)
T
cells
.

Polymorphic
residues
within
the
HLA
cytoplasmic
region
may
affect
Nef
's
downregulation
activity
.

However
,
the
effects
of
HLA
polymorphisms
on
recognition
by
primary
Nef
isolates
remain
elusive
,
as
do
the
specific
Nef
regions
responsible
for
downregulation
of
HLA-A
versus
HLA-B
.

Here
,
we
examined
46
Nef
clones
isolated
from
chronically
HIV-1
subtype
B
-infected
subjects
for
their
ability
to
downregulate
various
HLA-A
,
HLA-B
,
and
HLA-C
molecules
on
the
surface
of
virus
-infected
cells
.

Overall
,
HLA-B
exhibited
greater
resistance
to
Nef
-mediated
downregulation
than
HLA-A
,
regardless
of
the
cell
type
examined
.

As
expected
,
no
Nef
clone
downregulated
HLA-C
.

Importantly
,
the
differential
abilities
of
patient
-derived
Nef
clones
to
downregulate
HLA-A
and
HLA-B
correlated
inversely
with
the
sensitivities
of
HIV
-infected
target
cells
to
recognition
by
effector
cells
expressing
an
HIV-1
Gag-specific
T
cell
receptor
.

Nef
codon
function
analysis
implicated
amino
acid
variation
at
position
202
(
Nef-202
)
in
differentially
affecting
the
ability
to
downregulate
HLA-A
and
HLA-B
,
an
observation
that
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
experiments
using
Nef
mutants
constructed
by
site
-directed
mutagenesis
.

The
in
silico
and
mutagenesis
analyses
further
suggested
that
Nef-202
may
interact
with
the
C-terminal
Cys-Lys-Val
residues
of
HLA-A
,
which
are
absent
in
HLA-B
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
show
that
natural
polymorphisms
within
Nef
modulate
its
interaction
with
natural
polymorphisms
in
the
HLA
cytoplasmic
tails
,
thereby
affecting
the
efficiency
of
HLA
downregulation
and
consequent
recognition
by
HIV-specific
T
cells
.

These
results
thus
extend
our
understanding
of
this
complex
pathway
of
retroviral
immune
evasion
.

IMPORTANCE
:
Recognition
of
genetically
diverse
pathogens
by
the
adaptive
immune
system
represents
a
primary
strategy
for
host
defense
;
however
,
pathogens
such
as
HIV-1
can
evade
these
responses
to
achieve
persistent
infection
.

The
HIV-1
nef
gene
and
the
HLA
class
I
locus
rank
among
the
most
diverse
genes
of
virus
and
host
,
respectively
.

The
HIV-1
Nef
protein
interacts
with
the
cytoplasmic
region
of
HLA-A
and
HLA-B
and
downregulates
these
molecules
to
evade
cellular
immunity
.

By
combining
molecular
,
genetic
,
and
in
silico
analyses
,
we
demonstrate
that
patient
-derived
Nef
clones
downregulate
HLA-A
more
effectively
than
HLA-B
molecules
.

This
in
turn
modulates
the
ability
of
HIV-specific
T
cells
to
recognize
HIV
-infected
cells
.

We
also
identify
a
naturally
polymorphic
site
at
Nef
codon
202
and
HLA
cytoplasmic
motifs
(
GG314
,
315
and
CKV339-341
)
that
contribute
to
differential
HLA
downregulation
by
Nef
.

Our
results
highlight
new
interactions
between
HIV-1
and
the
human
immune
system
that
may
contribute
to
pathogenesis

currently
under
intense
investigation

.

The
clinical

,
ThRIL
,
recently
commenced
at

,
proposes
to
use
Treg
cell
therapy
to
induce

in
liver

,
the
success
of
which
has
the
potential
to
revolutionize
the
management
of
these
patients
and
enable
a
future
of
drug-free

.

This
is
the
first
report
of
the
manufacture
of
clinical

Tregs
from
prospective

technique
and
expanded
using
anti-CD3

We
report
the

Our

proved
successful
in
,
influencing
the

The
data
presented
in
this
manuscript
together
with
the
much
-anticipated
clinical

Unique

Newly

negligible
amounts
of
organic

.

Heterotrophic
organisms

bioavailable
carbon

that
are
provided
from

by
pioneer

However
,
the
knowledge
of
initial
ecosystem
developmental
mechanisms
,
especially
the
association
between
microbial
succession
and
environmental
change
,
is
still
limited
.

This
study
reports
the
unique
process
of
microbial
succession
in
fresh
basaltic
ash
,
which
was
affected
by
long-term
exposure
to
volcanic
sulfur
dioxide
(
SO2
)
.

Here
we
compared
the
microbial
ecosystems
among
deposits
affected
by
SO2
exposure
at
different
levels
.

The
results
of
metagenomic
analysis
suggested
the
importance
of
autotrophic
iron
-oxidizing
bacteria
,
particularly
those
involved
in
CO2
and
N2
fixation
,
in
the
heavily
SO2
affected
site
.

Changes
in
the
chemical
properties
of
the
deposits
after
the
decline
of
the
SO2
impact
led
to
an
apparent
decrease
in
the
iron-oxidizer
abundance
and
a
possible
shift
in
the
microbial
community
structure
.

Furthermore
,
the
community
structure
of
the
deposits
that
had
experienced
lower
SO2
gas
levels
showed
higher
similarity
with
that
of
the
control
forest
soil
.

Our
results
implied
that
the
effect
of
SO2
exposure
exerted
a
selective
pressure
on
the
pioneer
community
structure
by
changing
the
surrounding

of
the

is
a
multifunctional
viral

,
which
is
involved
in
suppressing
the

for
the

.

In
this
study
,
site

analysis
showed
that
the
R128A
or
R129A
mutation
introduced
into
a
highly
conserved
motif
(
(

)
reduced
the
ability
of
nsp1β
to
suppress

activation
and
also
impaired

Three

vRR129AA
,
carrying
single

GKYLQRRLQ
motif
were
characterized
.

In
comparison
to
the
wild-type
(
WT
)
virus
,
vR128A
and
vR129A
showed
slightly
reduced
growth
abilities
,
while
the
vRR129AA
mutant
had
a
significantly
reduced
growth
ability
in

.

Consistent
with
the
attenuated
growth
phenotype
in

,
pigs
infected
with
nsp1β
mutants
had
lower
levels
of
viremia
than
did
WT
virus

pigs
.

Compared
to
the
WT
virus
in
infected
cells
,
all
three
mutated
viruses
stimulated
high
levels
of
IFN-α

exhibited
a
reduced
ability
to
suppress
the
mRNA
expression
of

)
.

In
pigs
infected
with

mutants
,
IFN-α
production
was
increased
in
the
lungs
at
early
time
points
postinfection
,
which
was
correlated
with
increased
innate
NK
cell
function
.

Furthermore
,
the
augmented
innate
response
was
consistent
with
the
increased
production
of
IFN-γ
in
pigs
infected
with
mutated
viruses
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
residues
R128
and
R129
are
critical
for
nsp1β
function
and
that
modifying
these
key
residues
in
the
GKYLQRRLQ
motif
attenuates
virus
growth
ability
and
improves
the
innate

adaptive
immune
responses
in
infected
animals
.

IMPORTANCE

of
Aedes
aegypti
,
the
Main
Arbovirus
Vector
in
the
Pacific
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
Pacific
region
is
an
area
unique
in
the
world
,
composed
of
thousands
of
islands
with
differing
climates
and
environments
.

The
spreading
and
establishment
of
the
mosquito
Aedes
aegypti
in
these
islands
might
be
linked
to
human
migration
.

Ae.
aegypti
is
the
major
vector
of
arboviruses
(
dengue
,
chikungunya
and
Zika
viruses
)
in
the
region
.

The
intense
circulation
of
these
viruses
in
the
Pacific
during
the
last
decade
led
to
an
increase
of
vector
control
measures
by
local
health
authorities
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
analyze
the
genetic
relationships
among
Ae.
aegypti
populations
in
this
region
.

METHODOLOGY
/
PRINCIPAL
FINDING
:
We
studied
the
genetic
variability
and
population
genetics
of
270
Ae.
aegypti
,
sampled
from
9
locations
in
New
Caledonia
,
Fiji
,
Tonga
and
French
Polynesia
by
analyzing
nine
microsatellites
and
two
mitochondrial
DNA
regions
(
CO1
and
ND4
)
.

Microsatellite
markers
revealed
heterogeneity
in
the
genetic
structure
between
the
western
,
central
and
eastern
Pacific
island
countries
.

The
microsatellite
markers
indicate
a
statistically
moderate
differentiation
(
FST
=
0.136
;
P
<
=
0.001
)
in
relation
to
island
isolation
.

A
high
degree
of
mixed
ancestry
can
be
observed
in
the
most
important
towns
(
e.g.
Noumea
,
Suva
and
Papeete
)
compared
with
the
most
isolated
islands
(
e.g.
Ouvea
and
Vaitahu
)
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
indicated
that
most
of
samples
are
related
to
Asian
and
American
specimens
.

CONCLUSIONS
/
SIGNIFICANCE
:
Our
results
suggest
a
link
between
human
migrations
in
the
Pacific
region
and
the
origin
of
Ae.
aegypti
populations
.

The
genetic
pattern
observed
might
be
linked
to
the
island
isolation
and
to
the
different
environmental
conditions
or
ecosystems

TREM2
modifies
microglial
phenotype
and
provides
neuroprotection
in
P301S
tau
transgenic
mice
.

As
a
novel
risk
gene
for
Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
,
triggering
receptor
expressed
on
myeloid
cells
2
(
TREM2
)
gene
encodes
a
type
I
transmembrane
receptor
that
is
uniquely
expressed
by
the
microglia
in
the
brain
.

Emerging
evidence
indicates
a
strong
association
between
TREM2
and
tau
pathology
in
the
cerebral
spinal
fluid
or
brain
tissue
of
AD
patients
.

In
line
with
these
clinical
findings
,
we
found
that
TREM2
was
upregulated
in
the
brain
of
P301S
mice
,
an
animal
model
of
tau
pathology
,
during
disease
progression
.

However
,
despite
this
information
,
the
precise
role
of
TREM2
in
tau
pathology
remains
largely
unknown
.

In
our
recent
studies
,
we
revealed
that
silencing
microglial
TREM2
expression
in
P301S
mice
exacerbated
spatial
cognitive
deficits
and
tau
pathology
.

Based
on
this
evidence
,
we
hypothesized
that
TREM2
might
exert
a
protective
effect
in
tau
-related
neurodegenerative
diseases
.

In
the
present
study
,
to
test
this
hypothesis
,
a
lentiviral
-mediated
strategy
was
employed
to
selectively
overexpress
TREM2
on
microglia
in
the
brain
of
P301S
mice
.

For
the
first
time
,
we
showed
that
TREM2
overexpression
rescued
spatial
cognitive
impairments
and
ameliorated
neuropathologies
including
neuronal
and
synaptic
loss
as
well
as
tau
hyperphosphorylation
.

Meanwhile
,
this
protective
effect
was
likely
attributed
to
the
suppression
of
neuroinflammation
and
subsequent
attenuation
of
tau
kinase
activity
,
since
the
expression
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
including
Tnf
,
Il1b
and
Il6
as
well
as
the
activity
of
tau
kinase
including
glycogen
synthase
kinase
3β
and
cyclin
-dependent
kinase
5
was
significantly
reduced
following
TREM2
overexpression
.

Additionally
,
the
suppressed
neuroinflammation
might
be
ascribed
to
the
M2
activation
of
microglia
induced
by
TREM2
,
as
the
expression
of
M2
phenotype
makers
including
Arg1
,
Retnla
,
Il4
and
Il10
was
markedly
increased
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
support
the
concept
of
TREM2
as
a
valuable
target
against
AD
as
well
as
other
tau
-related
neurodegenerative
diseases

BACKGROUND
:
Critically
ill
patients
are
at
high
risk
to
suffer
from
sepsis
,
even
in
the
absence
of
an
initial
infectious
source
,
but
the
molecular
mechanisms
for
their
increased
sepsis
susceptibility
,
including
a
suppressed
immune
system
,
remain
unclear
.

Although
microbes
and
pathogen
-associated
molecular
pattern
are
accepted
inducers
of
sepsis
and
septic
immunosuppression
,
the
role
of
endogenous
Toll
-like
receptor
(
TLR
)
ligands
,
such
as
mitochondrial
DNA
(
mtDNA
)
,
in
altering
the
immune
response
is
unknown
.

METHODS
:
Mitochondrial
DNA
serum
concentrations
of
the
mitochondrial
genes
D-Loop
and
adenosine
triphosphatase
6
were
determined
(
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
)
in
165
septic
patients
and
50
healthy
volunteers
.

Furthermore
,
cytotoxic
T-cell
activity
was
analyzed
in
wild-type
and
TLR9
knockout
mice
,
with
/
without
previous
mtDNA
administration
,
followed
by
injection
of
an
ovalbumin
-expressing
adenoviral
vector
.

RESULTS
:
Mitochondrial
DNA
serum
concentrations
were
increased
in
septic
patients
(
adenosine
triphosphatase
6
,
123-fold
;
D-Loop
,
76-fold
,
P
<
0.0001
)
compared
with
volunteers
.

Furthermore
,
a
single
mtDNA
injection
caused
profound
,
TLR9
-dependent
immunosuppression
of
adaptive
T-cell
cytotoxicity
in
wild-type
but
not
in
TLR9
knockout
mice
and
evoked
various
immunosuppressive
mechanisms
including
the
destruction
of
the
splenic
microstructure
,
deletion
of
cross
-presenting
dendritic
cells
,
and
up-regulation
of

death
ligand
1
and
indoleamine
2
,
3-dioxygenase
.

Several
of
these
findings
in
mice
were
mirrored
in
septic
patients
,
and
mtDNA
concentrations
were
associated
with
an
increased
30-day
mortality
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
findings
of
this
study
imply
that
mtDNA
,
an
endogenous
danger
associated
molecular
pattern
,
is
a
hitherto
unknown
inducer
of
septic

Anti-inflammatory
effect
of
fullerene
C60
in
a
mice
model
of
atopic
dermatitis
.

BACKGROUND
:
Water-soluble
form
of
fullerene
C60
is
a
promising
tool
for
the
control
of
ROS
-dependent
inflammation
including
allergic
diseases
.

Anti-inflammatory
effects
of
C60
(
nC60
)
aqueous
dispersion
were
evaluated
in
the
mouse
models
of
atopic
dermatitis
using
subcutaneous
(
SC
)
and
epicutaneous
(
EC
)
applications
during
50
days
period
.

A
highly
stable
nC60
was
prepared
by
exhaustive
dialysis
of
water-organic
C60
solution
against
water
,
where
the
size
and
ζ
-potential
of
fullerene
nanoparticles
are
about
100
nm
and
-30
mV
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:
To
induce
skin
inflammation
,
female
BALB
/
c
mice
were
EC
sensitized
with
ovalbumin
three
times
during
one-weekly
exposures
.

The
nC60
solution
was
administrated
in
mice
subcutaneously
(
SC
)
(
0.1
mg
/
kg
)
and
epicutaneously
(
EC
)
(
1
mg

)
.

Significant
suppression
of
IgE
and
Th2
cytokines
production
and
a
concomitant
rise
in
concentrations
of
Th1
cytokines
were
observed
in
nC60
-treated
groups
.

In
addition
,
a
significant
increase
in
the
levels
of
Foxp3
(
+
)
and
filaggrin
mRNA
expression
was
observed
at
EC
application
.

Histological
examination
of
skin
samples
indicated
that
therapeutic
effect
was
achieved
by
both
EC
and
SC
treatment
,
but
it
was
more
effective
with
EC
.

Pronounced
reduction
of
the
eosinophil
and
leukocyte
infiltration
in
treated
skin
samples
was
observed
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
suppose
that
nC60
treatment
shifts
immune
response
from
Th2
to
Th1
and
restores
to
some
extent
the
function
of
the
skin
barrier
.

This
approach
can
be
a
good
alternative
to
the
treatment
of
allergic
and
other
inflammatory
diseases

Identification
of

II
ADP-ribosylation
factors
as
cellular
factors
required
for

C
virus
replication
.

GBF1
is
a
host
factor
required
for
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
replication
.

GBF1
functions
as
a
guanine
nucleotide
exchange
factor
for
G-proteins
of
the
Arf
family
,
which
regulate
membrane
dynamics
in
the
early
secretory
pathway
and
the
metabolism
of
cytoplasmic
lipid
droplets
.

Here
we
established
that
the
Arf-guanine
nucleotide
exchange
factor
activity
of
GBF1
is
critical
for
its
function
in
HCV
replication
,
indicating
that
it
promotes
viral
replication
by
activating
one
or
more
Arf
family
members
.

Arf
involvement
was
confirmed
with
the
use
of
two
dominant
negative
Arf1
mutants
.

However
,
siRNA
-mediated
depletion
of
Arf1
,
Arf3
(
class
I
Arfs
)
,
Arf4
or
Arf5
(
class
II
Arfs
)
,
which
potentially
interact
with
GBF1
,
did
not
significantly
inhibit
HCV
infection
.

In
contrast
,
the
simultaneous
depletion
of
both
Arf4
and
Arf5
,
but
not
of
any
other
Arf
pair
,
imposed
a
significant
inhibition
of
HCV
infection
.

Interestingly
,
the
simultaneous
depletion
of
both
Arf4
and
Arf5
had
no
impact
on
the
activity
of
the
secretory
pathway
and
induced
a
compaction
of
the
Golgi
and
an
accumulation
of
lipid
droplets
.

A
similar
phenotype
of
lipid
droplet
accumulation
was
also
observed
when
GBF1
was
inhibited
by
brefeldin
A
.

In
contrast
,
the
simultaneous
depletion
of
both
Arf1
and
Arf4
resulted
in
secretion
inhibition
and
Golgi
scattering
,
two
actions
reminiscent
of
GBF1
inhibition
.

We
conclude
that
GBF1
could
regulate
different
metabolic
pathways
through
the
activation
of
different
pairs
of
Arf
proteins

Unexpectedly
,

observed
that
the
critical
soluble
mediators
of

cells
,

,
synergize
in

,
the
key
enzyme
in

and
the
subsequent

)
within

,
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS

)
,
IL10
,
and
additional
COX2
result
in
strong
feedback
suppression
of
type-1
immune
responses
.

This
paradoxical
immune
suppression
driven
by
type-1
immune
cell
activation
was
found
to
depend
on
the
synergistic
action
of
IFNγ
and
TNFα
,
and
could
not
be
reproduced
by
either
of
these
factors
alone
.

Importantly
,
from
a
therapeutic
standpoint
,
these
negative
feedback
limiting
type-1
responses
could
be
eliminated
by
COX2
blockade
,
allowing
amplification
of
type-1
immunity
in
the
ovarian
cancer
TME

Our
data
demonstrate
a
new
mechanism
underlying
the
self
-limiting
nature
of
type-1
immunity
in
the
human
TME
,
driven
by
the
synergistic
induction
of
COX2
by

provide

rationale

BACKGROUND
:
Avian
infectious
bronchitis
is
a
highly
contagious
disease
of
the
upper-respiratory
tract
caused
by
infectious

Understanding
the
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
the
interaction
between
innate

is
a
crucial
element
for
further
improvements
in
strategies
to

IB
.

To
this

,
two

,
32
birds
from
each

were
used
.

Sixteen
birds
from
each
line
were
infected
with
IBV
and
sixteen
were
left
uninfected
.

Eight
uninfected
and
infected
birds
from
each
line
were
euthanized
at
1
and
3
weeks
post
infection
.

RNA
sequencing
was
performed
on
spleen
samples
from
all
64
birds
and
differential
gene
expression
analysis
was
performed
for
four
comparisons
:
L10L
line
versus
L10H
line
for
uninfected
birds
at
weeks
1
and
3
,
respectively
,
and
in
the
same
way
for
infected
birds
.

Functional

RESULTS
:
Comparing

For
the

When
comparing

CONCLUSIONS
:
Healthy
birds
from
the
two
lines
showed
significant
differences
in
expression
profiles
for
subsets
of
adaptive

innate
immunity
-related
genes
,
whereas
comparison
of
the
IBV
-infected
birds
from
the
two
lines
showed
differences
in
expression
of
immunity
-related
genes
involved
in
T
cell
activation
and
proliferation
.

The
observed
transcriptome
differences
between
the
two
lines
indicate
that
selection
for
MBL
had
influenced
innate
as
well
as
adaptive
immunity

BACKGROUND
:
Accurate
quantitative
assessment
of
infection
with
soil
transmitted
helminths
and
protozoa
is
key
to
the
interpretation
of
epidemiologic
studies
of
these
parasites
,
as
well
as
for
monitoring
large
scale
treatment
efficacy
and
effectiveness
studies
.

As
morbidity
and
transmission
of
helminth
infections
are
directly
related
to
both
the
prevalence
and
intensity
of
infection
,
there
is
particular
need
for
improved
techniques
for
assessment
of
infection
intensity
for
both
purposes
.

The
current
study
aimed
to
evaluate
two
multiplex
PCR
assays
to
determine
prevalence
and
intensity
of
intestinal
parasite
infections
,
and
compare
them
to
standard
microscopy
.

METHODOLOGY
/
PRINCIPAL
FINDINGS
:
Faecal
samples
were
collected
from
a
total
of
680
people
,
originating
from
rural
communities
in
Timor-Leste
(
467
samples
)
and
Cambodia
(
213
samples
)
.

DNA
was
extracted
from
stool
samples
and
subject
to
two
multiplex
real-time
PCR
reactions

duodenalis
,
and
Strongyloides
stercoralis
.

Samples
were
also
subject
to
sodium
nitrate
flotation
for
identification
and
quantification
of
STH
eggs
,
and
zinc
sulphate
centrifugal
flotation
for
detection
of
protozoan
parasites
.

Higher
parasite
prevalence
was
detected
by
multiplex
PCR
(
hookworms
2.9
times
higher
,
Ascaris
1.2
,
Giardia
1.6
,
along
with
superior
polyparasitism
detection
with
this
effect
magnified
as
the
number
of
parasites
present
increased
(

40.2
%
vs.
38.1

.

Although
,
all
STH
positive
samples
were
low
intensity
infections
by
microscopy
as
defined
by
WHO
guidelines
the
DNA-load
detected
by
multiplex
PCR
suggested
higher
intensity
infections
.

CONCLUSIONS
/
SIGNIFICANCE
:
Multiplex
PCR
,
in
addition
to
superior
sensitivity
,
enabled
more
accurate
determination
of
infection
intensity
for
Ascaris
,
hookworms
and
Giardia
compared
to
microscopy
,
especially
in
samples
exhibiting
polyparasitism
.

The
superior
performance
of
multiplex
PCR
to
detect
polyparasitism
and
more
accurately
determine
infection
intensity
suggests
that
it
is
a
more
appropriate
technique
for
use
in
epidemiologic
studies
and
for
monitoring
large-scale
intervention

.

Both
the
inflammatory

during
aging
.

The
association
between
the
repertoire
of
inflammatory
biomarkers
and
cognitive
decline
is
unclear
.

Inflammatory
cytokines
have
been
reported
to
be
increased
,
decreased
,
or
unchanged
in
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
and
sera
of
subjects
with
dementia
.

We
assessed
112
postmortem
brains
from
subjects
diagnosed
with
poststroke
dementia
(

)
,
vascular
dementia
,
mixed
dementia
,
and
Alzheimer
's
disease
(

)
,
comparing
those
to
poststroke
nondemented
(
PSND
)
subjects
and
age
-matched
controls
.

We
analyzed
5
brain
regions
including
the
gray
and
white
matter
from
the
frontal
and
temporal
lobes
for
a
panel
of
cytokine
and
/
or
chemokine
analytes
using
multiplex-array
assays
.

Of
the
37
analytes
,
14
were
under
or
near
the
detection
limits
,
7
were
close
to
the
lowest
detection
level
,
and
16
cytokines
were
within
the
linear
range
of
the
assay
.

We
observed
widely
variable
concentrations
of
C
-reactive
protein
(
CRP
)
and
serum
amyloid
A
at
the
high
end
(
1-150
ng
/
mg
protein
)
,
whereas
several
of
the
interleukins
(
IL
,
interferon-gamma
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
)
at
the
low
end
(
1-10
pg
/
mg
)
.

There
were
also
regional
variations
;
most
notable
being
high
concentrations
of
some
cytokines
(
e.g.
,
CRP
and
angiogenesis
panel
)
in
the
frontal
white
matter
.

Overall
,
we
found
decreased
concentrations
of
several
cytokines
,
including
IL-1
beta
(
p
=
0.000
)
,
IL-6
(
p
=
0.000

,

(
p
=
0.000
)
,
IL-8
(
p
=

)
,
IL-16
(
p
=
0.001
)
,
interferon-inducible
protein-10
(
0.044
)
,
serum
amyloid
A
(
p
=
0.011
)
,
and
a
trend
in
IL-1
alpha
(
p
=
0.084
)
across
all
dementia
groups
compared
to
nondemented
controls
.

IL-6
and
IL-8
were
significantly
lower
in
dementia
subjects
than
in
nondemented
subjects
in
every
region
.

In
particular
,
lower
levels
of
IL-6
and
IL-8
were
notable
in
the
PSD
compared
to
PSND
subjects
.

Because
these
2
stroke
groups
had
comparable
degree
of
vascular
pathology
,
the
lower
production
of
IL-6
and
IL-8
in
PSD
reaffirms
a
possible
specific
involvement
of
immunosenescence
in
dementia
pathogenesis
.

In
contrast
,
CRP
was
not
altered
between
dementia
and
nondementia
subjects
or
between
PSD
and
PSND
.

Our
study
provides
evidence
not
only
for
the
feasibility
of
tracking
cytokines
in
postmortem
brain
tissue
but
also
suggests
differentially
impaired
inflammatory
mechanisms
underlying
dementia
including
AD
.

There
was
a
diminished
inflammatory
response
,
possibly
reflecting
immunosenescence
and
cerebral
atrophy
,
in
all
dementias
.

Strategies
to
enhance
anti-inflammatory
cytokines
and
boost
the
immune
system
of
the
brain
may
be
beneficial
for
preventing
cognitive
dysfunction
,
especially
after
stroke

)
tolerize
mature
NK

responses
toward

.

NK
cells
generate
cytolytic
responses
to
virus
-infected
or
malignant
target
cells
with
altered
or
decreased
MHC-I
surface
expression
due
to
the
loss
of
tolerizing
ligands
.

The
NKG2A

CD94
iNKR
suppresses
NK
cell
responses
through
recognition
of
the
non-classical

We
used

as
targets
in
an
in

cytolytic
assay
with
autologous

.

In
these
experiments
,
primary
NKG2A

NK
cells
surprisingly
generated
the
most

responses
toward
HIV
-infected
T-cells
,
despite
high
HLA-E
expression
on
the
infected

.

Since
certain
MHC-I
-presented
peptides
can
alter
recognition
by
iNKRs
,
we
hypothesized
that
HIV-1
-derived
peptides
presented
by
HLA-E
on
infected
cells
may
block
engagement
with
NKG2A

,
thereby
engendering
susceptibility
to
NKG2A
/
CD94
(

)
NK
cells
.

We
demonstrate
that
HLA-E
is
capable
of
presenting
a
highly
conserved
peptide
from
HIV-1
capsid
(
AISPRTLNA
)
that
is
not
recognized
by
NKG2A

.

We
further
confirmed
that
HLA-C
expressed
on
HIV
-infected
cells
restricts
attack
by
KIR2DL
(
+
)

,
in
contrast
to
the
efficient
responses
by

bright
)
NK
cells
,
which
express
predominantly
NKG2A
/
CD94
and
lack
KIR2DLs
.

These
findings
are
important
since
the
use
of
NK

was
recently
proposed
to
treat
latently
HIV-1

patients
in
combination
with

agents
.

Our
results
provide
a
mechanistic

to

these

through
an
alternate
binding
site
to
the
SCF
(
FBXW11
)
E3
ligase
.

We
further
show
that
disrupting
the
assembly
of
the
SCF
(
FBXW11-NSs
)
E3
ligase
with
MLN4924
(
a
small
molecule
inhibitor
of
SCF
E3
ligase
activity
)
or
NSs
degron
viral
mutants
or
siRNA
knockdown
of
FBXW11
can
block
PKR
degradation
.

Surprisingly
,
under
these
conditions
when
PKR
degradation
was
blocked
,
NSs
was
essential
and
sufficient
to
activate
PKR
causing
potent
inhibition
of
RVFV
infection
by
suppressing
viral
protein
synthesis
.

These
antiviral
effects
were
antagonized
by
the
loss
of
PKR
expression
or
with
a
NSs
deleted
mutant
virus
.

Therefore
,
early
PKR
activation
by
disassembly
of
SCF
(
FBXW11-NSs
)
E3
ligase
is
sufficient
to
inhibit
RVFV
infection
.

Furthermore
,
FBXW11
and
BTRC
are
the
two
homologues
of
the
βTrCP
(
Beta-transducin
repeat
containing
protein
)
gene
that
were
previously
described
to
be
functionally
redundant
.

However
,
in
RVFV
infection
,
among
the
two
homologues
of
βTrCP
,
FBXW11
plays
a
dominant
role
in
PKR
degradation
and
is
the
limiting
factor
in
the
assembly
of
the
SCF
(
FBXW11
)
complex
.

Thus
,
FBXW11
serves
as
a
master
regulator
of
RVFV
infection
by
promoting
PKR
degradation
.

Overall
these
findings
provide
new
insights
into
NSs
regulation
of
PKR
activity
and
offer
potential
opportunities
for
therapeutic
intervention
of
RVFV
infection
.
