CONCLUSIONS	11
:	1
These	5
findings	8
suggest	7
that	4
the	3
chromosome	10
17q21	5
locus	5
relates	7
to	2
episodes	8
of	2
acute	5

to	2
both	4
transient	9

and	3
asthma	6

The	3

the	3

two	3
faces	5

In	2
our	3

that	4
silencing	9

Based	5

Meanwhile	9

this	4

Additionally	12

the	3

ascribed	8

the	3
